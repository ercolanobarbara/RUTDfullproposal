\subsubsection{\Tcol Links to the other Forschergruppe projects and international collaborators}
\label{subsec:links}
The team (Kley, Dullemond, Ercolano) have all the necessary expertise
to carry out the hydrodynamical numerical modeling and calculating observational implications
to compare to existing observations. 
In addition
collaboration with the groups of Th.~Henning (MPIA), E.~van Dishoeck
(MPE/Leiden), M.~Benisty (Grenoble/Santiago) and C.~Dominik (Amsterdam) is
envisioned for the comparison to observational data with ALMA and SPHERE.

As these simulations will require intensive computational effort and efficient codes,
we plan to collaborate closely with Andrea Mignone (Torino, I) who is the developer of the PLUTO code.
We will also strengthen ties to Dr. Pablo Ben\'itez-Llambay (currently at Copenhagen, DK) 
who is the lead author of the FARGO-3D public code.

\connect{A strong collaboration within this Forschergruppe will be carried out with the postdoc of project D2.
Projects D1 and D2 have several methods in common, in particular both employing 2-D and 3-D
(radiation-)hydrodynamics of protoplanetary disks. 
On the technical side both postdocs are envisioned to collaborate closely. 
The first two sub-projects of D2 are also topically somewhat overlapping with project D1:
focusing on planet-disk interaction as an explanation for Type 2 TDs. 
The differences are: in D2 we focus on single massive companions, presumably low mass stars rather than planets,
while project D1 focuses more on multiple planet-mass companions. Secondly, D2 focuses on finding
the origin of strong deviations from circular symmetry, in part by making the companion's orbit strongly
eccentric. Finally, D2 aims at explaining the extremely tilted inner disks of several Type 2 TDs, which
is not a goal of D1.
