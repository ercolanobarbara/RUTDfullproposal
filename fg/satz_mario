Hi Kees,

folgender Satz ist "universell" anwendbar:

In line with the collaboration A1-B3, and depending on the influence of
particle composition on the results of the coagulation experiments, this
project will also use realistic materials such as Mg, Ca, Al silicates
and/or Fe-Ni metal for the planned coagulation experiments.

Grüße,

Mario
