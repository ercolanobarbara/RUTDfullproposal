\noindent{\bf Abstract:}\\
Type 1 Transition disks (TDs) are thought to be disks in an advanced stage of dispersal
(see introduction to the Research Unit). The
modality of disk dispersal has been shown to be of fundamental importance to planet
formation, yet the responsible mechanism is still largely
unconstrained. Photoevaporation from the central star is currently a
promising avenue to investigate, but the models developed to date do
not yet have enough predictive power for a piecewise comparison with
the observations. In this project we aim at building the most
comprehensive radiation-hydrodynamical calculations of irradiated disks, 
coupled to photoionisation, chemistry and radiative transfer
calculations for a large parameter space, covering stars of different
masses and X-ray properties. This will constitute the backbone for the work carried
out in several sub-projects of this proposal (e.g. B2, C2), which together
aim at performing quantitative
spectroscopy of disk winds. Comparison with existing and upcoming
observations will allow us to constrain the mass loss rates and the
launching regions of the wind and thus pin down the underlying driving disk
dispersal mechanism. 
The models developed in this project will also the able to tackle
several important outstanding questions about the formation and evolution of
Type I TDs, as disussed in more detail below. 

\section{State of the art and preliminary work}
\renewcommand{\leftmark}{\sc State of the Art and preliminary work}

\subsection{Scientific Background}

Understanding disk dispersal is a key piece in the puzzle of planet
formation. Type 1 TDs, which are considered to be objects caught in
the act of dispersal, provide a tight constraints on the underlaying
dispersal mechanism. For example, their (low) frequency, in relation
to the global disk population in a given cluster, implies dispersal
timescales of order 10\% of the global disk timescale, and their
evolution on the colour-colour plane (e.g.\ K-[8] versus K-[24]) points
to an inside-out mode of 
dispersal \citep[e.g.,][]{2011MNRAS.410..671E, 2013MNRAS.428.3327K,
2015MNRAS.452.3689E}.
%(e.g.\ Ercolano, Clarke \& Hall, 2011; Koepferl, Ercolano et
%al. 2013; Ercolano et al. 2015). 

The most successful of the various disk dispersal mechanisms
proposed to date is considered to be photoevaporation by radiation
from the central star
\citep[e.g.,][]{2001MNRAS.328..485C}. Indeed, when combined with
viscous theory for the accreting disk, this model can
reproduced the observed dispersal timescales. 
%(e.g.\ Clarke et al. 2001). 
As described in more details below, in this
framework the disk is dispersed because
the mass loss rate due to a photoevaporative wind eventually exceeds the mass accretion
rate through disk, allowing the disk to quickly be eroded from the inside-out.

Recent work suggests that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects may also
drive disk winds 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2013ApJ...769...76B}
% (e.g.\ Bai \& Stone, 2013), 
which may lead to disk
dispersal and at the same time remove angular momentum from the
system, thus allowing the inward flow of material, i.e.\ accretion. 
Some preliminary estimates suggest that MHD winds may be 
comparable to photoevaporative winds in their strength, and that
non-ideal MHD effects may also dominate over
magneto-rotational-instability  \citep[MRI, ]{1991ApJ...376..214B} in the transport of
angular momentum (i.e. accretion) through the disk. 
While these models are still in their infancy and the
mass loss and accretion rates from MHD winds are at present highly
uncertain, they still raise important questions about the validity of
the majority of 
disk models which rely on $\alpha$ prescriptions. However a number of
important uncertainties need to be resolved before the relevance of
non-ideal MHD effects to disk evolution can be assessed. These include
include the strong dependence of the wind and
accretion rates on the completely unknown magnetic flux distribution
through the disk and, most importantly, magnetic flux evolution as a
function of surface density of the disk 
\citep[e.g.\ discussion in][]{2013ApJ...778L..14A} 
Another key ingredient is the level of ionisation in the
atmosphere of disks, which determines the nature of the gas coupling to
the magnetic field. \connect{While details of the magnetic field
structure and evolution are difficult to determine at present, the
joint efforts of sub-projects B1, B2 and C2 can deliver the most
detailed case-specific assessment to date of the ionisation structure in disk
atmospheres. This is indeed one of the aims, which is described in
project B2 (PIs Caselli \& Ercolano)\footexplainconnect.}

In this project we focus solely on photoevaporative winds, where the
underlying physics is better understood and the observations can be
used to constrain a number of important parameters, thus reducing the
degrees of freedom involved. 

In the following two sections the state-of-the art for photoevaporation
models, to which the PI and collaborators have made significant contributions, will be discussed.
 
\subsubsection{Photoevaporation models} 

All models of photoevaporation show that radiation from the central
star heats the disk atmosphere, setting off a thermal wind.
The wind is centrifugally launched from the location where the thermal
energy of the heated gas exceeds the local gravitational binding
energy. 
Disk dispersal then sets in as a consequence of this wind when the mass
loss rate exceeds the accretion rates in the disk. According to
viscous theory, young disks accrete
at a vigorous rate, which naturally decreases as time goes by
\citep[e.g.,][]{2008apsf.book.....H},
until,
after a few million years, accretion rates fall to values smaller than
the wind rates, allowing photoevaporation to take over the further
evolution of the disk. Once the dispersal sets in the disk is then
quickly eroded from the inside out going through the transition disk
phase, before disappearing completely
\citep[see e.g.,][for recent reviews of this process]{2014prpl.conf..475A,
2011ARA&A..49..195A}.
%(see e.g.\ Alexander et al. 2014 and
%Armitage 2011, for recent reviews of this process).  


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth, angle = 270]{profiles.pdf}
  \caption{From \citet{2011ARA&A..49..195A}. Different photoevaporation profiles
    corresponding to the EUV-only model of \citet{2006MNRAS.369..216A, 2006MNRAS.369..229A},

    \citet{2009ApJ...705.1237G}. The profiles have been
    normalised, where the total mass loss rates can differ by over two
    orders of magnitude. }
  \label{fig:profiles}
\end{figure}


While the community now agrees on this broad brush picture,
quantitatively speaking, the dispersal mechanism is still largely
unconstrained. There is currently a hot debate in the literature as to
what type of radiation may be the main driver of the wind: Extreme-,
Far-UV or X-ray. This is a fundamental question as the mass-loss-rates
implied by the different models can differ by orders of
magnitudes. The mass loss rates determine the timescales of dispersal for
given initial disk conditions. The wind profile, i.e.\ the region of
the disk that is most affected by photoevaporation, is also very
different in each scenario 
\citep[e.g.][]{2014prpl.conf..475A, 2011ARA&A..49..195A}.
%(e.g.\ see Armitage 2011, Alexander et al. 2014). 
Figure~\ref{fig:profiles} shows the mass loss profile for the X-ray+EUV
\citep{2010MNRAS.401.1415O},
%(Owen, Ercolano et al. 2010),
EUV-only 
\citep{2004ApJ...607..890F}
%(Font et al. 2004) 
and FUV
%(Gorti, Dullemond \& Hollenbach 2009)
\citep{2009ApJ...705.1237G}
profiles. The X-ray profile is much
more extended than the EUV profile, which predicts mass loss only from
a vary narrow range of disk radii. The FUV model is again very
different, showing mass loss from the outer regions of the disk, hence
predicting in some cases an outside-in mode of dispersal. These
differences have important implications for the planet formation and
the migration 
process. For example, the total
mass loss rates in the disk sets the timescales for the formation of
gas giants, and together with the wind
profiles it sculpts the disk density distributions, profoundly affecting
the evolution of all planetary systems, by putting a stop to migration via
the formation of gaps in the gas. As an example, we have shown that
the photoevaporation profile strongly influences the final semi-major
axis distribution of exo-planets 
\citep{2015MNRAS.450.3008E}.
%(Ercolano \& Rosotti, 2015) 

While the importance of the final stages
of disk evolution to understand planet formation and explain the
diversity of exoplanets is largely recognised, a quantitative model describing this phase is
still lacking. The reason for that is that all current models are
somewhat 
incomplete. Some models focus on hydrodynamics and 
assume isothermal gas 
\citep[e.g.\ the EUV-only model of][]{2004ApJ...607..890F}
%(e.g.\ the EUV-olny model of Font et al. 2004), 
others focus on
chemistry but do not perform hydrodynamical calculations 
\citep[e.g.\ the FUV model of][]{2009ApJ...705.1237G}.
%(e.g.\ the FUV model of Gorti, Dullemond \& Hollenbach 2009). 
None of the existing models take into
account dust evolution in the underlying disk and entrainment of
grains in the wind. Together with James Owen, a former PhD student I co-supervised
at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, I performed
the only existing radiation hydrodynamic calculations of X-ray  + EUV driven
winds to date 
\citep{2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O,
  2012MNRAS.422.1880O}. For this calculation
%(Owen, Ercolano et al. 2010, 2011a, 2012), 
we used realistic gas
temperatures obtained from X-ray photoionisation calculations
\citep{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E}.
%(Ercolano et al. 2008, 2009). 
This led to a fundamental re-think to the
whole problem, as previous isothermal calculations had yielded much
lower mass loss rates (by two orders of magnitude). However, our
models, which still represents the state-of-the-art, also have
important limitations, since, most importantly, they do not include
chemistry and ignore the dust phase. Furthermore the resolution at
which the simulations were performed is insufficient to study lines with
emission regions extending close to the disk inner edge. The parameter
space covered by these models is also rather small. These
limitations make the application of current models to observations
impossible.  

As well as the uncertainties on mass loss rates and wind profiles,
which directly affect planet formation, there are also a number of
open questions regarding photoevaporation and the formation of the
observed TDs. A recent review by 
\citet{2016PASA...33....5O}
%Owen (2016) 
provides a discussion of
the current successes and problems of theoretical models in
explaining the origin and evolution of TDs. Here we will just list a
few issues that we believe should have priority in the development of a
quantitative theory which can be used to interpret observations. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The observations of TDs have yet to reveal objects with large
  holes that do not accrete. Photoevaporation, however, predicts that a
  significant population of them should exist, unless the final
  removal is dominated by a fast run-away
  phase called ``thermal sweeping''. 
  \citep{2012MNRAS.422.1880O}.
% (Owen et al. 2012).
  The
  efficiency of  ``thermal sweeping'' has however recently been called
  into question 
  \citep{2016MNRAS.457.1905H}, however as will be discussed in more
  details below, a detailed calculation of thermal
  sweeping is still lacking. 
% (Haworth et al. 2016). 
\item The role played by FUV heating in the removal of the outer disk
  is unclear, due to the lack of hydrodynamical calculations that
  include this heating channel. FUV heating may provide a solution to the
 previous item, at least in some cases. 
\item Current estimates of the TD demographics as predicted by the X-ray
  model are based on extrapolations of the results with stellar mass
  and stellar emission properties. The validity of these
  extrapolations has yet to be proved. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Contribution of this team to the current state-of-the-art}

The first photoevaporation models developed were based on EUV
irradiation only. This was mainly due to the need of simplifying the
hydrodynamics by assuming an isothermal gas
\citep[]{2006MNRAS.369..216A, 2006MNRAS.369..229A}. 
An EUV heated gas, where
hydrogen is almost fully ionised, is indeed roughly isothermal
($\sim$10$^4$K), while the temperatures of a quasi-neutral X-ray
heated gas generally vary from a few hundred to a few thousand 
Kelvin. Here the hydrogen gas cannot directly be ionised by the X-ray
photons, 
thus it achieves only a very low level of ionisation, with the
exact ionisation level influencing the efficiency of the X-ray
heating. While the EUV-photoionisation process occurs of via the removal
of a single valence electron, X-rays generally remove an inner-shell
electron from a metal (e.g. C, N, O). The ejected supra-thermal electron produces then secondary
ionisations (of mostly H and He). A further complication is that multiple electrons may be
ejected as a consequence of inner shell ionisations, linking together
non-adjacent ionisation levels.

 The host of microphysics regulating
X-ray ionisation and heating is self-consistently included in the
three-dimensional photoionisation code MOCASSIN 
\citep{2003MNRAS.340.1136E, 2005MNRAS.362.1038E, 2008ApJS..175..534E}
%(Ercolano et al. 2003, 2005, 2008a) 
and has been applied to the X-ray photoionisation and
photoevaporation problem of protoplanetary disks 
\citep{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E, 
2010MNRAS.406.1553E, 2016MNRAS.460.3472E, 
2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O, 2012MNRAS.422.1880O}
%(Ercolano et al. 2008b, 2009, 2010, 2016; Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012). 


In 
\citet{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E}
%Ercolano et al. (2008b,2009)
the relevance of the X-ray photoevaporation process
to the dispersal of disks was proven for the first time. Indeed the mass
loss rates calculated were approximately two order of magnitude larger
than those previously obtained by the EUV-only model, able to compete
with observed accretion rates from T-Tauri stars. These early results
were based on hydrostatic calculations, which were later improved by
our 2D radiation-hydrodynamic calculations 
\citep{2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O, 2012MNRAS.422.1880O},
%(Owen, Ercolano et al. 2010, 2011, 2012), 
which still represent the state-of-the-art in
this field. This work also provided detailed mass-loss radial profiles
that have been used by us and others to study the photoevaporation
process in combination with planet formation in 1D and 2D
\citep[e.g.,][]{2013MNRAS.430.1392R, 2015MNRAS.454.2173R, 2015MNRAS.450.3008E}.
%(e.g.\ Rosotti, Ercolano et al. 2013, 2015; Ercolano et al. 2015). 

Over the last few years we explored several possibilities to test and refine our
models against observations. In 
\citet{2010MNRAS.406.1553E, 2016MNRAS.460.3472E}
%Ercolano \& Owen (2010, 2016)
and in
\citet{2010MNRAS.401.1636S}
%Schisano, Ercolano \& G\"udel (2010)
we
produced synthetic line profiles of forbidden transitions of heavy
metals observed in the optical and in the mid-infrared. We came to the
conclusion, however, that the strong temperature dependance of these
lines makes them unsuitable for use as wind diagnostics. 

In 
\citet{2010MNRAS.402.2735E}
%Ercolano \& Clarke (2010) 
we explored the metallicity dependance of the mass
loss rates, hoping for hints from disk statistics in several
regions. While available data support our predictions 
\citep{2009AIPC.1158..171Y, 2010ApJ...723L.113Y},
%(Yasui et al. 2009, 2010), 
these observations are challenging and have
remained sparse. The importance of the effects we noted in this
work for planet formation has however been widely recognised
\citep[e.g.,][]{2016arXiv161001170L}.
%(e.g.\ Lopez 2016). 

In 
\citet{2013MNRAS.434.3378O}
%Owen, Scaife \& Ercolano (2013)
we tested the models using
predictions at radio wavelengths. We were able to show in that work that our
observations of the famous transition disk around GM Aur were
consistent with our models, but could not really distinguish between
a EUV-only or an X-ray driven scenario. This line of work was however
used again by 
\citet{2014ApJ...795....1P}
%Pascucci et al. (2014)
to show that the EUV flux
impinging on protoplanetary disks is generally low, hence arguing
against a EUV-only model for dispersal. 

The work described in this section has provided the basis for many theoretical
and observational investigations, which cannot all be described
here. We will only finally mention our most recent application where
we were able to use our model to argue that the inner-most gap imaged
with ALMA by 
\citet{2016ApJ...820L..40A}
%Andrews et al. (2016)
in the disk around TW Hya, is
likely photoevaporative in origin 
\citep{2017MNRAS.464L..95E}.
%(Ercolano et al. 2017).

  rates calculated in the previous papers (Ercolano et al. 2008, 2009). The rates obtained here

  We explore the role of X-ray photoevaporation in the evolution and

  that X-rays play a dominant role in the evolution and dispersal of

  We produce new synthetic observations of a particularly promising

  time (before Simon et al. 2016) are consistent with the
  photoevaporation model. We show however that this line cannot be

 In this letter we show that the innermost gap in the disk around TW
 Hya, recently imaged by Andrews et al. (2016) with ALMA, is very
 likely due to X-ray photoevaporation. We demonstrate how all current
 observational data fit the predictions of the model and provide new
 estimates for the timescales of dust-draining from the inner disk.

   hydrodynamical code of the evolution of Bonnor-Ebert (BE) spheres
   and compare the results with observations.  For the first time, we
   demonstrate that dense cloud cores contract as unstable
   quasi-equilibrium BE spheres, while the singular isothermal sphere
   and Larson-Penston solutions for dense core contraction do not
   reproduce the observed line profiles.  This was only
   computationally possible
   because the number of reactions was reduced to the core. A similar
   approach will be used in B1 and B2.

is to identify new wind tracers and use them to constrain mass loss rates and hence
disk dispersal models, leading to the formation and evolution of Type 1
transition disks. 

The new comprehensive radiation-hydrodynamics photoevaporation models
developed in this project will enable a quantitative
spectroscopic evaluation of new diagnostics of disk winds, via
detailed astrochemical models developed together with project B2,
using the dust model for the wind and atmosphere from project C2. }

We will perform a comparison between TDs and
primordial disk to provide important constraints on the wind
architecture and the mechanism driving the dispersal. 
Type 1 TDs, are particularly interesting as the streamline architecture of their winds
and the profiles of the lines that are produced in the wind
differ from those of primordial disks. (e.g.\ Ercolano \& Owen
2010, Ercolano \& Pascucci, 2017, in prep.). Indeed the lines
are expected to be broader and brighter for e.g.\ inner cavities of a few to 10 AUs.  

The immediate objective of project B1 is to produce a new set of
X-ray+UV photoevaporation models which goes well beyond the current
state-of-the-art, described in the previous section. 

\connect{The new models will constitute the backbone for the joint
investigation to be carried out in projects B2 and C2}, as well as
allowing us to address the following important unsolved questions in
the formation of Type 1 transition disks and their further evolution: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item How fast do Type 1 TDs evolve/disappear after the inner disk has
  drained?
\item How does the formation \& evolution of Type 1 TDs scale with
  stellar mass and stellar emission properties?
\item What is the role of FUV heating in the late evolution of Type 1
  transition disks? 
\end{enumerate}

%{Test whether Type 2 TDs (large holes, large accretion rates) may
%result from radiative transfer effects on a tilted inner disc. This
%idea stems from  the recent suggestion (e.g.\ Marino et al. 2015, Montesino et
%al. 2016) that some Type 2 TDs may have a tilted inner disc. 
%A tilted inner disk may strongly influence photoevaporation by
%allowing radiation to reach outer disk regions and may produce the
%large inner holes of (some) Type 2 TDs. This is certainly a worthwhile
%new challenge requiring the development of 3D simulations.  }

\subsection{Work programme including proposed research methods}
% for each applicant
In this project we will construct a
library of high resolution X-ray+EUV wind solutions for an extended grid of
X-ray luminosities and stellar masses, covering all observed
values. Our new calculations will make use of a new temperature
scheme (Ercolano, Picogna \& Owen, 2017, in prep.), derived from
new more extensive X-ray + EUV photoionisation models.  The new
temperature scheme
significantly reduces the error at low ionisation parameter values,
allowing us to make solid predictions of the late evolution of
transition disks. 

Furthermore, our previous calculations 
\citep{2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O, 2012MNRAS.422.1880O},
%(Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012)
could only account for heating 
in the ionised phase of the wind, ignoring that the region beyond the
layer heated by the soft X-ray ($<1keV$) which could be heated by FUV
radiation with typical PDR or XDR characteristics. While we show in
\citet{2012MNRAS.422.1880O},
%Owen et al. (2012), 
that this should not affect the mass loss rates at
around 1-10~AU, the effect of FUV heating at larger radii may be
important. This is particularly relevant to the late evolution of
transition disks, when the cavity becomes larger than approximately
30~AU. Indeed one of the
problems with current photoevaporation models is the prediction of a
large number of non-accreting transition disks with large holes
\citep[e.g.,][]{2016PASA...33....5O}.
%(e.g.\ Owen 2016). 
In this project we will be able to test the
suggestion that FUV heating may take over the late-stage evolution of
transition disks, speeding up their final complete erosion. 

%We have recently coupled our 3D X-ray and EUV Monte Carlo photoionisation
%code MOCASSIN to the KROME package to solve the chemistry in the
%deeper layers of the disk (Ercolano \& Grassi, 2017, in
%preparation). The code has been benchmarked for a simple toy network,
%but we will need input from project B2 to include an appropriate
%network to model this region and devise a new temperature scheme to
%include in our radiation-hydrodynamic simulations.   


\subsubsection{Research Tools}

For this project we will need the following tools: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A hydrodynamical code modified to include the
  effects of X-ray + EUV irradiation as we did in 
  \citet{2010MNRAS.401.1415O}.
%Owen et al. (2010). 
  For
  that we use the Pluto code, for which extensive expertise
  exists in our team and in other teams of this Research Unit (e.g. D1
  \& D2 -- PIs Kley \& Dullemond).
\item An efficient astrochemistry package to include a reduced
  chemical network into PLUTO. For that we will use KROME 
  \citep{2014MNRAS.439.2386G}  
%(Grassi et al. 2014) 
and link it with PLUTO. Dr Grassi will take active part in helping
with the implementation of the algorithm.
\item An efficient radiative transfer algorithm to model the region
  just beyond the X-ray dominated region. We can use initially the
  implementation of radiative transfer and stellar irradiation
for the PLUTO code 
\citep{2013A&A...559A..80K},
%(Kolb et al., 2013), 
developed by the group of Kley
(PI of project D2). If this is proved not to be sufficient for our
aims, the PI also has experience in the
development of hybrid algorithms  
\citep{2014ASSP...36..127O}.
%(Owen, Ercolano \& Clarke 2014).

\paragraph{Preparatory work}

In this section we will describe
preparatory work that is currently being carried out by Dr
Picogna. Dr Picogna is currently employed in the group of Prof. Ercolano via
an Excellent Initiative grant from the LMU, awarded to the PI to carry
out preparatory work for this Research Unit proposal. The grant, which
was extended using funds from the faculty will end in November
2017. 

The determination of gas temperatures in a photoionised gas, in a
photodissociation region (PDR) or in an X-ray dissociated region (XDR)
is computationally expensive. It requires, first of all 
performing a radiative transfer (RT) calculation in order to determine the
radiation field at each point of the region. Then matrices of thermal and
ionisation balance and/or rate equations have to be solved. The RT and
the balance/rate equation are often coupled through the
temperature-dependent gas opacities, and one needs to iterate to
obtain a solution. There is a host of microphysics
that needs to be taken into account, last but not least the thermal
coupling of the gas and the dust phase. Even an extremely simplified
version of the above has large computational costs, if it needs to be performed at
every time-step of a hydrodynamical calculation. 

In such cases it is convenient to look for parameterisations of the
gas temperature in terms of quantities that are easy to determine on
the fly during the hydrodynamical run (e.g.\ gas properties and/or column density). 
Indeed the radiation-hydrodynamical calculations of X-ray + EUV driven
photoevaporative winds of 
\citet{2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O, 2012MNRAS.422.1880O},
%(Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012), 
described in the previous section, were performed
using such a temperature paremeterisation. The parameterisation was
determined via detailed X-ray photoevaporation models using the
MOCASSIN code 
\citep{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E}
%(Ercolano et al. 2008, 2009)
The models were run with a version of the {\sc
  zeus2d} code which was modified by us to include a temperature
scheme based on the ionisation parameter at each cell in the
calculation. 
This was based on our previous work 
\citep{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E}.
%Ercolano et al. (2008, 2009). 
where it was shown that, within the
penetration depth of $\sim$1keV X-rays ($\sim 10^{22}cm^{-2}$), the
temperature of a parcel of gas with hydrogen number density, $n_H$, at
distance $r$ from the central star, could be roughly approximated by a
function of the ionisation parameter, defined as $L_X/(r^2 n_H)$,
where$L_X$ is the stellar X-ray luminosity. The error on the
temperature was found to be small for high ionisation parameter values, but it
becomes systematically larger at the low end. 

As the gas temperature enters the hydrodynamics via the square root
dependance in the sound speed, the small error at high values of the
ionisation parameter, typical for the regions where the bulk of the
wind is driven from in primordial disks, is unlikely to produce large
uncertainties in the mass loss rates. For more evolved objects, like
transition disks in the phase of final dispersal, however, the ionisation
parameter decreases dramatically as the cavity becomes larger. The
evolution of transition disks depends thus sensitively on the temperature
of the gas at low ionisation parameters, which is currently poorly
represented by the parameterisation of 
\citet{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E}.
% Ercolano et al. (2008, 2009). 
Note that the recent work of 
\citet{2016MNRAS.457.1905H},
%Haworth, Clarke \& Owen (2016), 
presents a form of the temperature ionisation parameter relation which is incorrect at
low values of the ionisation parameter. The kink at ionisation
parameters just above $10^{-7}$ (left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:xite}) is an artefact of their implementation
of the photoionisation models. We have recently performed new detailed
photoionisation calculations and obtained the curve shown in the right
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:xite} (Ercolano, Picogna \& Owen, 2017, in prep.).
Figure~\ref{fig:xite} shows no kink in the temperature parameterisation at
low ionisation parameter, which is important as some of the
conclusions reached by
\citet{2016MNRAS.457.1905H} are a consequence of this kink.  Our
collaborators J. Owen and C. Clarke, as well as the first author, Dr Haworth, have been informed of the problem
and agree with our more recent calculations. Furthermore we have now
found a more accurate scheme that allows us to reduce the error on the
temperature by taking into account the gas column density as an additional
parameter. 

As well as the major shortcoming highlighted above, the Owen et
al. (2010) calculations which were used to make predictions on
the ionised phase of the wind spectra 
\citep{2010MNRAS.406.1553E, 2016MNRAS.460.3472E},
%(Ercolano \& Owen 2010; Ercolano \& Owen 2016), 
suffered from low spatial resolution,
precluding us from being able to model the inner region of the bound disk, which
may be relevant to interpret the broad wings of some of the
wind-tracing emission lines presented in the recent
work of 
\citet{2016ApJ...831..169S}.
%Simon et al. (2016). 
Furthermore, a very limited
parameter space was investigated, which included only two values for
stellar mass, 3 values of X-ray luminosity for primordial disks and a
single stellar mass and X-ray luminosity value for transition disks
with 3 values for the cavity radius. This is not enough to draw 
significant conclusions about trends in possible wind diagnostics. 

In this project we aim at constructing new photoionisation models to
remedy the shortcoming of the current models highlighted above. To
that aim we have modified the hydrodynamical code PLUTO 
\citep{2007ApJS..170..228M, 2012A&A...545A.152M}
%(Mignone et al. 2007, 2012) 
to include the
effects of X-ray and EUV irradiation using the temperature-ionisation
parameter from 
\citet{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E}
%Ercolano et al. (2008,2009) 
also employed by 
\citet{2010MNRAS.401.1415O}
%Owen et al. (2010)
for the ZEUS2D calculations. We have implemented the
standard scheme in order to be able to compare our wind solutions to 
those available for a 0.7 and 0.1 M$_\odot$ central
stars 
\citep{2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O, 2012MNRAS.422.1880O},
%(Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012), 
for similar spatial
resolution. This will ensure that we have implemented the algorithm
correctly in PLUTO, before we move on with project B1 and implement
the improved temperature scheme.

   % Figure 1 of this proposal. 

\subsubsection{Months 1-12}
In the preparatory work described in the previous section we have
implemented the standard temperature scheme from 
\citet{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E}
%Ercolano et al.\ (2008, 2009) 
into PLUTO and have benchmarked the results against
the work of 
\citet{2010MNRAS.401.1415O}.
%Owen et al.\ (2010). 
In the first 12 months of the Research
Unit we will then proceed with the implementation of the new, more accurate
temperature scheme described in the previous Section (Ercolano,
Picogna \& Owen, 2017, in prep.). We will compare the resulting
wind rates and profiles for the primordial and transition disk
case presented by Owen et al. (2010). While we do not foresee large
changes in the rates for primordial disks, as described in the
previous section the evolution of transition disks will be most 
likely affected. 

In particular we will test the late evolution of transition disks to
estimate whether there is a radius for the inner cavity at which
photoevaporation stalls. In that case one would expect to be able to
observe a population of transition disks with large cavity and no
accretion signature (relic disks), which to date remains elusive. A solution to this
problem, form the theoretical stand-point, would be the triggering of
a fast final clearing phase, as the proposed final thermal sweeping
(Owen et al. 2011). Our models will be able to test this hypothesis in
detail for the first time, as previous works have all been limited by
the uncertainties in the temperature parameterisation of the X-rays at
low ionisation parameters (e.g. Haworth et al 2016). \connect{We will then
create synthetic transition disk population to check the occurrence of relic disks and
compare it with the limits shown by current observational surveys from
which we will be informed by the A1 team. }

Furthermore, the new models will have much higher spatial
resolution extending much closer into the star, in order to allow
tracking the profile components of emission line which may be produced from the inner bound
atmosphere of the disk (see discussion in Ercolano \& Owen 2016 and in
the Introductory section of this proposal).

\connect{This first set of models for $\sim$solar mass stars at a typical X-ray
luminosity ($\sim 10^{30}$erg/sec) will be then passed on to projects
C2 and B2 for the dust and detailed chemistry calculations. }

\subsubsection{Months 13-24}

Once our machinery is complete and well-tested we will be able to
switch to production-mode and extend significantly the parameter space
of the calculations. Specifically, we will vary the mass of the central star and its X-ray
luminosity as well as the accretion properties of the
disk. Furthermore models of transitions disks at several stages 
of evolution, as tracked by the radius of their inner cavity, will be
performed. 

\connect{As new models become available and we populate the parameter space, we
will make the grids available immediately to projects C2 and B2 for
the dust and detailed chemistry calculations. At this stage we will
already start to regularly check our model predictions against
observations, with the help of experts from projects A1 and A2. }

The new models will also allow us to investigate how
the photoevaporation process scales with stellar mass and stellar emission
properties. We will test the theoretical relations for X-ray photoevaporation 
predicted by means of semi-analytical models and ab-initio arguments
by Owen et al.\ (2012). These relations are already being widely used in
the literature and they are a crucial ingredient for population
synthesis models of planet formation, where photoevaporation is
included in the disk evolution and affects the timescales and location for
the formation of giant planets, as well as their successive
migration. 

The larger parameter space will also allow us to improve on our
initial calculations to construct more accurate synthetic
populations of evolved disks to match
the observed demographics of Type 1 TDs. \connect{Note that project A1 will
keep an up-to-date record of the transition disk demographics
throughout the duration of the Research Unit. } \\

\subsubsection{Months 25-36} 
The role of FUV heating in supporting or competing with the X-rays in
the removal of the disk is still uncertain. As we discussed in the
previous sections, the work of Gorti, Dullemond \& Hollenbach
(2009), based on 1+1D thermochemical calculations in hydrostatic
equilibrium, suggest that a vigorous thermal wind may be driven as a
result of FUV-heating. For some disk parameters (in particular in the
presence of PAHs), the FUV is shown to reach mass-loss-rates
comparable to those driven by X-rays. An hydrodynamical calculation of
an FUV driven wind is however still lacking and it is urgently needed
in order to assess the importance of this process, in particular at
large disk radii, which is relevant to the problem of disk relics,
amongst other things. 

\connect{At this stage of the Research Unit a robust and well tested
  reduced chemical network should be available from project B2 (PI
  Caselli, Ercolano). We will now couple our modified version of the
  PLUTO code to the KROME package to solve the chemistry using the
  reduced network from B2 and obtain the temperatures of the gas on
  the fly in the regions beyond the X-ray dominated regions.} For 
that we will receive help from our collaborator Dr.\ Grassi, who is the main
developer of the KROME code. Dr.\ Picogna has already attended the KROME
school this year (\url{http://kromepackage.org/bootcamp/}) and a simple
feasibility test has shown that this is a realistic task. As an example,
KROME is already implemented in a number of hydrodynamics codes (e.g.\ {\sc
  ramses, enzo, flash, gasoline, gizmo}). A number of publications performed
with these codes are listed on the KROME webpage
(\url{http://www.kromepackage.org/}).

A streamlined form of radiative transfer
will be needed in PLUTO at this point, meaning that these calculations will
probably be expensive to run.  This is however necessary in order to
estimate the value of the  FUV field reaching different regions of the
disk atmosphere, where the optical depth are not high enough to
justify the use of a  (grey) flux limited diffusion method.
Implementation of an efficient radiative transfer algorithm in PLUTO
will be carried out together with the PI who has experience in the
development of hybrid algorythms 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2014ASSP...36..127O}.
\connect{A simple RT scheme is
already available for PLUTO 
\citep{2013A&A...559A..80K},
%(Kolb et al.\ 2013), 
which was developed in
the group of our Prof.\ Kley (PI from project D1). Hence there is
a substantial body of experience within our Research Unit team to
successfully perform this task.}

Note that we do not plan to run a full
parameter space grid including the effects of the FUV heating. 
Our simulations will be limited to a selected number of cases
aimed at specifically testing how strongly, and for what initial
conditions, FUV heating may affect the evolution of the outer regions
of disks, in particular of those in transition.\\

\subsubsection{Future Outlook}

A natural further step of this work is to perform a small set of 3D
simulations to explore the effects of asymmetries in the inner
disk and/or the presence of giant planets in the disk. We expect to
see dramatic effects in the photoevaporation 
profile and in the wind architecture, which may lead to the formation
of large hole TDs. This avenue has never been explored before and,
while these models come at severe computational costs, they are likely to provide us
with important insights on the structure and origin of TDs. 

\connect{In particular in the second funding period of the Research
  Unit, the results from sub-projects D1 and D2 will be available to
  us, and the natural further step will be to combine photoevaporation
to planet-disk interaction calculations. }


\subsection{Data handling}

A library of the hydrodynamical solutions in steady state (gas density
and velocity)  will be shared initially amongst the Research Unit
members only and will be made available online on the public partition
of the Research Unit server at the end of the first funding period.

in taking on the post. Dr Picogna is currently employed in the group of the
PI and is performing preparatory work for the project. Dr Picogna's
expertise in astrophysical fluid dynamics and his familiarity with the

\paragraph{Equipment up to EUR 10,000, Software and Consumables}

Theoretical numerical research can only be done when sufficient and
appropriate computational facilities are available. While production
runs will be done on supercomputer facilities, a substantial part of
the work in this project is code development. Testing these codes on
realistic problems requires a workstation for the postdoc -- which is

Paola Caselli, Director of MPE and of the Centre of Astrochemical
Studies at the MPE (permanent). Prof. Caselli will provide guidance in
treating the heating and cooling channels due to chemistry at the base
of the flow into our hydynamics calculations. 

Dr. Wing-Fi Thi, postdoc (current contract ends in 2009), works in the CAS group of Prof. Caselli and
is an expert in chemical models of protoplanetary disks. 

Dr Alexei Ivlev, researcher (permanent), works in the CAS  group of Prof. Caselli and
is an expert in grain charging and X-ray transport. 

\subsection{Cooperation with other researchers}

\subsubsection{Planned cooperation on this project}

\paragraph{Collaborating researchers for this project within the
  Research Unit}
%Each proposal must be accompanied by a description of how the project
%is integral to the Research Unit, %both in terms of subject matter
%and organisation. This includes a description of the cooperation with
%%others participating within the Research Unit. 

\connect{This project will provide the radiation-hydrodynamic models of the
wind which are needed by project B2 (PI: Prof.\ Caselli \& Prof.\ Ercolano) for the
chemical calculations and by project C2 (PI: Ercolano) for the dust
entrainment. Project BI depends on input from project B2 (PI:
Prof.\ Caselli \& Prof.\ Ercolano)  for the reduced network and on
project A2 (PI Prof.\ Preibisch) for observational input. Specifically
project A2 (Prof. Preibisch) can
provide insights on the emission properties of the irradiating
stars. We already have made used extensively of the results coming
from the group of Prof.\ Preibisch in terms of realistic X-ray
luminosity functions for the construction of population synthesis of
disks and of the individual X-ray spectra, when considering the
ionisation and heating of individual sources. At the end of the first
funding period and particularly in the second funding period of the
Research Unit, the results from sub-projects D1 (PI Kley) and D2 (PI
Dullemond) will be available to us, and the natural further step will
be to combine photoevaporation to 
planet-disk interaction calculations. Project B1 will provide
project C1 team (PIs Dr.\ Birnstiel, Prof.\ Dullemond) with the hydrodynamical models for
photoevaporating disks, to allow them to investigate dust growth in
pressure bumps formed at the inner edge of the outer disk.}

\paragraph{Collaborating researchers for this project outside of
  the Research Unit}
Dr.\ James Owen (Princeton) will be heavily involved in the
project. Dr.\ Owen developed the original
phoionisation models during his PhD project at the Institute of
Astronomy in Cambridge, which was co-supervised by
Prof.\ Ercolano. It is envisioned that Dr.\ Owen will pay regular visit
to our group to help with the development of the new models. 

Dr.\ Tommaso Grassi (STARplan Copenhagen, Denmark) is an expert of
chemistry and the microphysics of the ISM coupled with hydrodynamical
simulations of (e.g.) star-forming regions. He leads the development of the
KROME package (http://www.kromepackage.org/).
