\noindent{\bf Abstract:}\\
Type 1 Transition discs (TDs) are most likely discs in an advanced stage of dispersal
(see introduction to the Research Unit). The
dispersal mechanism of discs has been shown to be of fundamental importance to planet
formation, yet the responsible mechanism is still largely
unconstrained. Photoevaporation from the central star is currently a
promising avenue to investigate, but the models developed to date do
not yet have enough predictive power for a piecewise comparison with
the observations. In this subproject we aim at building the most
up-to-date radiation-hydrodynamical calculations of irradiated discs, 
coupled to photoionisation, chemistry and radiative transfer
calculations. This will constitute the backbone for the work carried
out in several sub-projects of this proposal (B2, C2), which together
aim at performing quantitative
spectroscopy of disc winds. Comparison with existing and upcoming
observations will allow us to constrain the mass loss rates and the
launching regions of the wind and thus pin down the underlying driving disc
dispersal mechanism. 
The models developed in this project will also the able to tackle
important outstanding questions about the formation and evolution of
Type I TDs, as discussed in more detail below. 

\section{\Tcol State of the art and preliminary work}
\renewcommand{\leftmark}{\sc State of the Art and preliminary work}

\subsection{Scientific Background}

Understanding disc dispersal is a key piece in the puzzle of planet
formation. Type 1 TDs, which are considered to be objects caught in
the act of dispersal provide a tight constraints on the underlaying
dispersal mechanism. For example, their (low) frequency, in relation
to the global disc population in a given cluster, implies dispersal
timescales of order 10\% of the global disc timescale, and their
evolution on the colour-colour plane (e.g. K-[8] versus K-[24]) points
to an inside-out mode of 
dispersal (e.g. Ercolano, Clarke \& Hall, 2011; Koepferl, Ercolano et
al. 2013; Ercolano et al. 2015). 

The most successful of the various disc dispersal mechanisms proposed
because it
matches many of the observational constraints, 
is photoevaporation by radiation from the central star
(e.g. Clarke et al. 2001). As described in more details below, in this
model the disc is dispersed because
the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation eventually exceeds the mass accretion
rate through disc, the wind can quickly destroy the disc, eroding from the inside-out.

Recent work suggests that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence may also
drive disc winds (e.g. Bai \& Stone, 2013), which may lead to disc
dispersal and at the same time remove angular momentum from the
system, thus allowing the inward flow of material, i.e. accretion. What is certain, however, is that if MHD winds are indeed
as vigorous as some authors claim, they would change the
way we understand disc evolution and dispersal, raising questions
about models that  rely on alpha-type discs. However, these models are still in their infancy and the
mass loss and accretion rates from MHD winds are at present highly
uncertain. Some of the main
sources of uncertainty include the strong dependence of the wind and
accretion rates on the completely unknown magnetic flux distribution
through the disc and, most importantly, magnetic flux evolution as a
function of surface density of the disc (e.g. discussion in Armitage
et al. 2013). Another key ingredient is the level of ionisation in the
atmosphere of discs, which determines the nature of the gas coupling to
this unknown magnetic field. While details of the magnetic field
structure and evolution are difficult to determine at present, the
joint efforts of sub-projects B1, B2 and C2 can deliver the most
detailed case-specific assessment to date of the ionisation structure in disc
atmospheres. This is indeed one of the aims, which is described in
subproject B2 (PIs Caselli \& Ercolano).  

In this subproject we focus solely on photoevaporative winds.
In the following two sections the state-of-the art for photoevaporation
models, to which the PI and collaborators have made significant contributions, will be discussed.
 
\subsubsection{Photoevaporation models} 

All models of photoevaporation show that radiation from the central
star heats the disc atmosphere, where a thermal  wind is established.
The wind is centrifugally launched from the location where the thermal
energy of the heated gas exceeds the local gravitational binding
energy. 
Disc dispersal then sets in as a consequence of the wind when the mass
loss rate exceeds the accretion rates in the disc. According to
viscous theory, young discs accrete
at a vigorous rate, which naturally decreases as time goes by
(e.g. Hartmann 2008), until,
after a few million years, accretion rates fall to values smaller than
the wind rates, allowing photoevaporation to take over the further
evolution of the disc. Once the dispersal sets in the disc is then
quickly eroded from the inside out (see e.g. Alexander et al. 2014 and
Armitage 2011, for recent reviews of this process).  


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth, angle = 270]{profiles.pdf}
  \caption{From Armitage (2011). Different photoevaporation profiles
    corresponding to the EUV-only model of Alexander et al. (2006),
    the EUV+X-ray of Owen et al. (2010) and FUV model estimates of
    Gorti, Dullemond \& Hollenbach (2009). The profiles have been
    normalised, where the total mass loss rates can differ by over two
    orders of magnitude. }
  \label{fig:profiles}
\end{figure}


While the community now agrees on this broad brush picture,
quantitatively speaking, the dispersal mechanism is still largely
unconstrained. There is currently a hot debate in the literature as to
what type of radiation may be the main driver of the wind: Extreme-,
Far-UV or X-ray. This is a fundamental question as the mass-loss-rates
implied by the different models can differ by orders of
magnitudes. Mass loss rates determine the timescales of dispersal for
given initial disc conditions. The wind profile, i.e. the region of
the disc that is most affected by photoevaporation, is also very
different in each scenario (e.g. see Armitage 2011, Alexander et
al. 2014). Figure~\ref{fig:profiles} shows the mass loss profile for the X-ray+EUV
(Owen, Ercolano et al. 2010), EUV -only (Font et al. 2004) and FUV
(Gorti, Dullemond \& Hollenbach 2009) profiles. The X-ray profile is
more extended than the EUV profile, which predicts mass loss only from
a vary narrow range of disc radii. The FUV model is again very
different, showing mass loss from the outer regions of the disc, hence
predicting in some cases an outside-in mode of dispersal. These
differences have important implications for the planet formation
process. For example, the total
mass loss rates in the disc sets the timescales for the formation of
gas giants, and together with the wind
profiles it sculpts the disc density distributions, profoundly affecting
the evolution of all planetary systems, by putting a stop to migration via
the formation of gaps in the gas. As an example, we have shown that
the photoevaporation profile strongly influences the final semi-major
axis distribution of exo-planets (Ercolano \& Rosotti, 2015) 

While the importance of the final stages
of disc evolution to understand planet formation and explain the
diversity of exoplanets is largely recognised, a quantitative model describing this phase is
still lacking. The reason for that is that all current models are
incomplete. Some models focus on hydrodynamics and 
assume isothermal gas (e.g. the EUV-olny model of Font et al. 2004), others focus on
chemistry but do not perform hydrodynamical calculations (e.g. the FUV
model of Gorti,
Dullemond \& Hollenbach 2009). None of the existing models take into
account dust evolution in the underlying disc and entrainment of
grains in the wind. Together with a PhD student I co-supervised
at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, I performed
the only existing radiation hydrodynamic calculations of X-ray  + EUV driven
winds to date (Owen, Ercolano et al. 2010, 2011a, 2012), using realistic gas
temperatures obtained from X-ray photoionisation calculations
(Ercolano et al. 2008, 2009). This led to a fundamental re-think to the
whole problem, as previous isothermal calculations had yielded much
lower mass loss rates (by two orders of magnitude). However, our
models, which still represents the state-of-the-art, also have
important limitations, since, most importantly, they do not include
chemistry and ignore the dust phase. Furthermore the resolution at
which the simulations were performed is insufficient to study lines with
emission regions extending close to the disc inner edge. These
limitations make the application of current models to observations
impossible.  

As well as the uncertainties on mass loss rates and wind profiles,
which directly affect planet formation, there are also a number of
open questions regarding photoevaporation and the formation of the
observed TDs. A recent review by Owen (2016) provides a discussion of
the current successes and problems of theoretical models in
explaining the origin and evolution of TDs. Here we will just list a
few issues that we think should have priority in the development of a
quantitative theory which can be used to interpret observations. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The observations of TDs have yet to reveal objects with large
  holes that do not accrete. Photoevaporation, however, predicts a
  significant population, unless the final removal is dominated by a
  process called ``thermal sweeping'' (Owen et al. 2012). The
  efficiency of  ``thermal sweeping'' has however recently been called
  into question (Haworth et al. 2016). 
\item The role played by FUV heating in the removal of the outer disc
  is unclear, due to the lack of hydrodynamical calculations that
  include this channel. FUV heating may provide a solution to the
 previous item, at least in some cases.
\item Current estimates of the TD populations predicted by the X-ray
  model are based on extrapolations of the results with stellar mass
  and stellar emission properties. The validity of these
  extrapolations has yet to be proved. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Contribution of this team to the current state-of-the-art}

The first photoevaporation models to be developed were based on EUV
irradiation only. This was mainly due to the need of simplifying the
hydrodynamics by assuming the gas is isothermal. 
An EUV heated gas, where
hydrogen is almost fully ionised, is indeed roughly isothermal
($\sim$10$^4$K), while the temperatures of a quasi-neutral X-ray
heated gas generally vary from a few hundred to a few thousand 
Kelvin. Here the hydrogen gas is in a quasi-neutral state of ionisation, with the
exact ionisation level influencing the efficiency of the X-ray
heating. While the EUV-photoionisation process occurs of via the removal
of a single valence electron, X-rays generally remove an inner-shell
electron. The ejected supra-thermal electron produces then secondary
ionisations. A further complication is that multiple electrons may be
ejected as a consequence of inner shell ionisations, linking together
non-adjacent ionisation levels.

 The host of microphysics regulating
X-ray ionisation and heating is self-consistently included in the
three-dimensional photoionisation code MOCASSIN (Ercolano et al. 2003,
2005, 2008a) and has been applied to the X-ray photoionisation and
photoevaporation process of protoplanetary discs (Ercolano et
al. 2008b, 2009, 2010, 2016; Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012). 

In Ercolano et al. (2008b,2009) the relevance of the photoevaporation process
to the dispersal of discs was proven for the first time. Indeed the mass
loss rates calculated were approximately two order of magnitude larger
than those previously obtained by the EUV-only model, able to compete
with observed accretion rates from T-Tauri stars. These early results
were based on hydrostatic calculations, which were later improved by
our 2D radiation-hydrodynamic calculations (Owen, Ercolano et
al. 2010, 2011, 2012), which still represent the state-of-the-art in
this field. This work also provided detailed mass-loss radial profiles
that have been used by us and others to study the photoevaporation
process in combination with planet formation in 1D and 2D
(e.g. Rosotti, Ercolano et al. 2013, 2015; Ercolano et al. 2015). 

We explored several possibilities to test and refine our
models against observations. In Ercolano \& Owen (2010, 2016) and in
Schisano, Ercolano \& G\"udel (2010) we
produced synthetic line profiles of forbidden transitions of heavy
metals observed in the optical and in the mid-infrared. We came to the
conclusion, however that the strong temperature dependance of these
lines makes them unsuitable for use as wind diagnostics. 

In Ercolano
\& Clarke (2010) we explored the metallicity dependance of the mass
loss rates, hoping for hints from disc statistics in several
regions. While available data support our predictions (Yasui
et al. 2009, 2010), these observations are challenging and have
remained sparse. The importance of the effects we noted in this
work for planet formation have however been widely recognised
(e.g. Lopez 2016). 

In Owen, Scaife \& Ercolano (2013) we tested the models using
predictions in the radio. We were able to show in that work that our
observations of the famous transition disc around GM Aur were
consistent with our models, but could not really distinguish between
a EUV-only or an X-ray driven scenario. This line of work was however
used again by Pascucci et al. (2014) to show that the EUV flux
impinging on protoplanetary discs is generally low, hence arguing
against a EUV-only model for dispersal. 

The work described here has provided the basis for many theoretical
and observational investigations, which cannot all be described
here. We will only finally mention our most recent application where
we were able to use our model to argue that the inner-most gap imaged
with ALMA by Andrews et al. (2016) in the disc around TW Hya, is
likely photoevaporative in origin (Ercolano et al. 2017). 

\subsection{Preliminary work}

The determination of gas temperatures in a photoionised gas, in a
photodissociation region (PDR) or in an X-ray dissociated region (XDR)
is computationally expensive. It requires, first of all 
performing a radiative transfer (RT) calculation in order to determine the
radiation field at each point of the region. Then matrices of thermal and
ionisation balance and/or rate equations have to be solved. The RT and
the balance/rate equation are often coupled through the
temperature-dependent gas opacities, and one needs to iterate to
obtain a solution. There is a host of microphysics
that needs to be taken into account, last but not least the thermal
coupling of the gas and the dust phase. Even a extremely simplified
version of the above has large computational costs if it needs to be performed at
every time-step of a hydrodynamical calculation. 

In such cases it is convenient to look for parameterisations of the
gas temperature in terms of quantities that are easy to determine in
the hydrodynamics code (e.g. gas properties and/or column density). 
Indeed using such a temperature paremeterisation,
determined via detailed X-ray photoevaporation models using the
MOCASSIN code (Ercolano et al. 2008, 2009) we have performed the
only existing radiation hydrodynamic 
calculations of X-ray + EUV driven photoevaporative winds to date (Owen et
al. 2010, 2011, 2012), as was described in the previous section. The models were run with a version of the {\sc
  zeus2d} code which was modified by us to include a temperature
scheme derived from the detailed X-ray and EUV photoionisation
calculations of protoplanetary discs of Ercolano et al. (2008,
2009). In that work it was shown that, within the
penetration depth of $\sim$1keV X-rays ($\sim 10^{22}cm^{-2}$), the
temperature of a parcel of gas with hydrogen number density, $n_H$, at
distance $r$ from the central star, could be roughly approximated by a
function of the ionisation parameter, defined as $L_X/(r^2 n_H)$,
where$L_X$ is the stellar X-ray luminosity. The error on the
temperature was found to be small for high ionisation parameter values, but it
becomes systematically larger at the low end.

  \label{fig:xite}
\end{figure}


As the gas temperature enters the hydrodynamics via the square root
dependance in the sound speed, the small error at high values of the
ionisation parameter, typical for the regions where the bulk of the
wind is driven from in primordial discs, is unlikely to produce large
uncertainties in the mass loss rates. For more evolved objects, like
transition discs in the phase of final dispersal, however, the ionisation
parameter decreases dramatically as the cavity becomes larger. The
evolution of transition discs depends thus sensitively on the temperature
of the gas at low ionisation parameters, which is currently poorly
represented by the parameterisation of Ercolano et al. (2008, 2009). 
Note that the recent work of Haworth, Clarke \& Owen (2016), described
in the previous section, presents a
form of the temperature ionisation parameter relation which is incorrect at
low values of the ionisation parameter. The kink at ionisation
parameters just above $10^{-7}$ (left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:xite}) is an artefact of their implementation
of the photoionisation models. We have recently performed new detailed
photoionisation calculations and obtained the curve shown in the right
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:xite} (Ercolano, Picogna \& Owen, 2017, in preparation).
Figure~\ref{fig:xite} shows the behaviour of the temperature parameterisation at
low ionisation parameter and for different column densities.  Our
collaborators J. Owen and C. Clarke, have been informed of the problem
and agree with our more recent calculations. Furthermore we have now
found a more accurate scheme that allows us to reduce the error on the
temperature by introducing  column density as an additional
parameter. 

As well as the major shortcoming highlighted above, the Owen et
al. (2010) calculations which were used to make predictions on
the ionised phase of the wind spectra (Ercolano \& Owen 2010;
Ercolano \& Owen 2016), suffered from low spatial resolution,
precluding us from being able to model the inner region of the bound disc, which
may be relevant to interpret the broad wings of some of the
wind-tracing emission lines presented in the recent
work of Simon et al. (2016). Furthermore, a very limited
parameter space was investigated, which included only two values for
stellar mass, 3 values of X-ray luminosity for primordial discs and a
single stellar mass and X-ray luminosity value for transition discs
with 3 values for the cavity radius. This is nowhere near enough to draw any
significant conclusions about trends in possible wind diagnostics. 

In this project we aim at constructing new photoionisation models to
remedy the shortcoming of the current models highlighted above. To
that aim we have modified the hydrodynamical code PLUTO (Mignone et
al. 2007, 2012) to include the
effects of X-ray and EUV irradiation using the temperature-ionisation
parameter from Ercolano et al. (2008,2009) also employed by Owen et
al. (2010) for the ZEUS2D calculations. We have implemented the
standard scheme in order to be able to compare our wind solutions to 
those available for a 0.7 and 0.1 M$_\odot$ central
stars (Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012), for similar spatial
resolution. This will ensure that we have implemented the algorithm
correctly in PLUTO.  This work is being carried out by Dr Picogna, who
is employed on a LMUExcellent grant awarded to the PI to carry out
preparatory work for the Research Unit. The grant ends in November
2017.

\section{\Tcol Objectives and work programme}
\renewcommand{\leftmark}{\sc Objectives and work programme}


\subsection{\Tcol Anticipated total duration of the project}

36 months

\subsection{\Tcol Objectives}


The overarching aim of this project, in common with projects B2 (PI
Caselli \& Ercolano) and C2 (PI Ercolano),
is to identify new wind tracers and use them to constrain mass loss rates and hence
disc dispersal models, leading to the formation and evolution of Type 1
transition discs. 

The new comprehensive radiation-hydrodynamics photoevaporation models
developed in this project will enable a quantitative
spectroscopic evaluation of new diagnostics of disc winds, via
detailed astrochemical models developed together with project B2,
using the dust model for the wind and atmosphere from project C2. 

We will perform a comparison between TDs and
primordial disc to provide important constraints on the wind
architecture and the mechanism driving the dispersal. 
Type 1 TDs, are particularly interesting as the streamline architecture of their winds
and the profiles of the lines that are produced in the wind
differ from those of primordial discs. (e.g. Ercolano \& Owen
2010, Ercolano \& Pascucci, 2017, in preparation). Indeed the lines
are expected to be broader and brighter for e.g. inner cavities of a few to 10 AUs.  

The immediate objective of project B1 is to produce a new set of
X-ray+UV photoevaporation models which goes well beyond the current
state-of-the-art, described in the previous section. 

The new models will constitute the backbone for the joint
investigation to be carried out in projects B2 and C2, as well as
allowing us to address the following important unsolved questions in
the formation of Type 1 transition discs and their further evolution: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item How fast do Type 1 TDs evolve/disappear after the inner disc has
  drained?
\item How does the formation \& evolution of Type 1 TDs scale with
  stellar mass and stellar emission properties?
\item What is the role of FUV heating in the late evolution of Type 1
  transition discs? 
\end{enumerate}

%{Test whether Type 2 TDs (large holes, large accretion rates) may
%result from radiative transfer effects on a tilted inner disc. This
%idea stems from  the recent suggestion (e.g. Marino et al. 2015, Montesino et
%al. 2016) that some Type 2 TDs may have a tilted inner disc. 
%A tilted inner disc may strongly influence photoevaporation by
%allowing radiation to reach outer disc regions and may produce the
%large inner holes of (some) Type 2 TDs. This is certainly a worthwhile
%new challenge requiring the development of 3D simulations.  }

%{\color{red} the marino and montesino idea must also be included in
 % the intro and also in the background section of this proposal}

\subsection{\Tcol Work programme including proposed research methods}
% for each applicant
In this project we will construct a
library of high resolution X-ray+EUV wind solutions for an extended grid of
X-ray luminosities and stellar masses, covering all observed
values. Our new calculations will make use of a new temperature
scheme (Ercolano, Picogna \& Owen, 2017, in preparation), derived from
new more extensive X-ray + EUV photoionisation models.  The new
temperature scheme
significantly reduces the error at low ionisation parameter values,
allowing us to make solid predictions of the late evolution of
transition discs. 

Furthermore, our previous calculations (Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012)
could only account for heating 
in the ionised phase of the wind, ignoring that the region beyond the
layer heated by the soft X-ray ($<1keV$) which could be heated by FUV
radiation with typical PDR or XDR characteristics. While we show in
Owen et al. (2012), that this should not affect the mass loss rates at
around 1-10~AU, the effect of FUV heating at larger radii may be
important. This is particularly relevant to the late evolution of
transition discs, when the cavity becomes larger than approximately
30~AU. Indeed one of the
problems with current photoevaporation models is the prediction of a
large number of non-accreting transition disc with large holes
(e.g. Owen 2016). In this project we will be able to test the
suggestion that FUV heating may take over the late-stage evolution of
transition discs, speeding up their final complete erosion. 

%We have recently coupled our 3D X-ray and EUV Monte Carlo photoionisation
%code MOCASSIN to the KROME package to solve the chemistry in the
%deeper layers of the disc (Ercolano \& Grassi, 2017, in
%preparation). The code has been benchmarked for a simple toy network,
%but we will need input from project B2 to include an appropriate
%network to model this region and devise a new temperature scheme to
%include in our radiation-hydrodynamic simulations.   


\subsection{Research Tools}

For this project we will need the following tools: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A hydrodynamical code modified to include the
  effects of X-ray + EUV irradiation as we did in Owen et al. (2010). For
  that we use the Pluto code, for which extensive expertise
  exists in our team. 
\item An efficient astrochemistry package to include a reduced
  chemical network into PLUTO. For that we will use KROME (Grassi et
  al. 2014) and link it with PLUTO. 
\item An efficient radiative transfer algorithm to model the region
  just beyond the X-ray dominated region. We can use initially the
  implementation of radiative transfer and stellar irradiation
for the PLUTO code (Kolb et al., 2013), developed by the group of Kley
(PI of project D2). If insufficient the PI also has experience in the
development of hybrid algorithms  (Owen, Ercolano \& Clarke 2014). 

% A photoionisation and chemical code which includes X-ray
 % heating and ionisation to obtain a new comprehensive temperature
 % scheme for the radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. The PI is the
 % author of the 3D Monte Carlo photoionisation and dust radiative
  %transfer code MOCASSIN (Ercolano et al. 2003, 2005, 2008b),
 % which has already been used to calculate the 
 % emission line spectra from the ionic phase of X-ray winds (Ercolano
 % \& Owen 2010; 2016). The code has
 % now been coupled and benchmarked to the KROME code to perform
 % arbitrary chemical calculations (Ercolano \& Grassi 2017, in prep)
 % and needs now only the appropriate chemical network, which
 % we will obtain from project B2.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Plan} 

%We have divided the work load into two connected blocks which
%also have self-contained immediate objectives. Preparatory work for
%Block 1 is already being executed by Dr Picogna, employed on a
%LMUExcellent initiative grant awarded to the PI in support of
%this Research Unit application (End date November 2017). In case of an award Dr Picogna
%has already agreed to continue his work for the Research Unit and will
%take over the tasks described in Block 1. 

A grid of significantly improved new photoevaporation models including
an accurate temperature scheme which includes X-ray, EUV and FUV
heating will be developed in this subproject, by means of
radiation-hydrodynamic calculations. 

%Block 2 will provide a new
%temperature scheme for the hydrodynamical calculations of Block 1, by
%performing detailed photoionisation calculations with simple chemistry
%using the MOCASSIN+KROME code. The PI will take full responsibility of
%the tasks described in Block 2 and will work closely with the postdoc
%employed for project B1
%for the implementation of the results in Block 1.  

%\subsubsection{Block 1: New state of the art radiation-hydrodynamic
 % models of photoionised winds.}

%\paragraph{Preparatory work: present until beginning of the award}



\subsubsection{Months 1-12}
In the preparatory work described in the previous section we have
implemented the standard temperature scheme from Ercolano et
al. (2008, 2009) into PLUTO and have benchmarked the results against
the work of Owen et al. (2010). In the first 12 months of the Research
Unit we will then proceed with the implementation of the new, more accurate
temperature scheme described in the previous Section (Ercolano,
Picogna \& Owen, 2017, in preparation). We will compare the resulting
wind rates and profiles for the primordial and transition disc
case. While we do not foresee large changes in the rates for
primordial discs, as described in the previous section the evolution of transition discs will be most
likely affected. 

The new models will have much higher spatial
resolution extending much closer into the star, in order to allow
tracking profile components which may be emitted from the inner bound
atmosphere of the disc. 

This first set of models for $\sim$solar mass stars at a typical X-ray
luminosity ($\sim 10^{30}$erg/sec) will be then passed on to projects
C2 and B2 for the dust and detailed chemistry calculations. 

\subsubsection{Months 13-24}

The parameter space of the calculations will be then
significantly extended for the mass of the central star and its X-ray
luminosity. Furthermore models of transitions discs at several stages
of evolution, as tracked by the radius of their inner cavity, will be
performed. 

With the new models we will also be able to investigate how
the process scales with stellar mass and stellar emission
properties. This will allow us to check the
theoretical relations for X-ray photoevaporation 
predicted by means of semi-analytical models and ab-initio arguments
by Owen et al. (2012). While these relations are being widely used in
the literature, they have until now never been tested. This will allow
us to construct accurate population synthesis calculations to match
the demographics of Type 1 TDs with those obtained with our models.\\

\subsubsection{Months 25-36} 
At this point a robust and well tested reduced chemical network should
be available from subproject B2 (PI Caselli, Ercolano). 
We will now couple our modified version of the PLUTO code to the
KROME package to solve the chemistry using the reduced network from B2
and obtain the temperatures of
the gas on the fly in the regions beyond the X-ray
dominated regions. For that we will receive help from our collaborator
Dr Grassi, who is the main developer of the KROME code. Dr Picogna has
already attended the KROME school this year (website??????) and a simple
feasibility test has shown that this is a realistic task. As an
example, KROME is already implemented in a number of hydrodynamics
codes (e.g. {\sc ramses, enzo, flash, gasoline, gizmo}). A number of
publications performed with these codes are listed on the KROME
webpage (http://www.kromepackage.org/).

A streamlined form of radiative transfer
will be needed in PLUTO at this point, meaning that these calculations will
probably be expensive to run.  This is likely necessary to estimate the value of the  FUV field
reaching different regions of the disc atmosphere, where the optical
depth are not high enough to justify the use of a  (grey) flux
limited diffusion method.  Implementation of an efficient
radiative transfer algorithm in PLUTO will be carried out together
with the PI who has experience in the development of hybrid
algorythms. (e.g. Owen, Clarke \& Ercolano 2014). A simple RT scheme is
already available for PLUTO (Kolb et al. 2013), which was developed in
the group of our Prof. Kley (PI from subproject D2). Hence there is
a substantial body of experience within our Research Unit team to
successfully perform this task.

Note that we do not plan to run a full
parameter space grid including the effects of the FUV heating. 
Our simulations will be limited to a selected number of cases
aimed at specifically testing how strongly, and for what initial
conditions, FUV heating may affect the evolution of the outer regions
of discs, in particular of those in transition.\\

\subsubsection{Future Outlook}

A natural further step of this work is to perform a small set of 3D
simulations to explore the effects of asymmetries in the inner
disc and/or the presence of giant planets in the disc. We expect to
see dramatic effects in the photoevaporation 
profile and in the wind architecture, which may lead to the formation
of large hole TDs. This avenue has never been explored before and,
while these models come at severe computational costs, they are likely to provide us
with important insights on the structure and origin of TDs. \\
