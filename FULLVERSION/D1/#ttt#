 M.~Benisty (Grenoble/Santiago) and C.~Dominik (Amsterdam) is
envisioned for the comparison to observational data with ALMA and SPHERE.

As these simulations will require intensive computational effort and efficient codes,
we plan to collaborate closely with Andrea Mignone (Torino, I) who is the developer of the PLUTO code.
We will also strengthen ties to Dr. Pablo Ben\'itez-Llambay (currently at Copenhagen, DK) 
who is the lead author of the FARGO-3D public code.
