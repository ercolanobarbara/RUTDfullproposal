\section{Summary}
%about half a  page

Recent surveys have shown an overwhelming diversity of extrasolar
planetary systems, prompting the question of how did they form,
and whether some may end up
looking like our own and being able to sustain life. Hints to answer
such fundamental questions may be hidden in the many trends that are
slowly emerging from the data. An example are the deserts and peaks in the distribution of
giant exoplanets, with clear implications for habitability of systems,
given the role played by giants on the delivery of volatiles to
terrestrial planets \citep[e.g.,][]{2014ApJ...786...33Q}. 

The environment
in which planets form plays a major role in understanding both the
variety of exoplanets and the emerging trends. Planets are
born out of the dust and gas left over whenever a new star forms: the
protoplanetary disk. The initial conditions for planet formation
are thus determined by the protoplanetary disks, which evolve and disperse as they
give birth to planets. Interestingly, the timescales of disk dispersal
are comparable to those of planet formation, suggesting that the
dispersal mechanism dominates disk evolution right at the time at
which planets form.  Conversely, the planet formation process also
strongly affects the disk, making the combined problem of planet formation
and disk evolution a strongly coupled and complex problem. 

Disks on the verge of dispersal, so-called ``Transition Disks'' (TDs),  are thus particularly important
witnesses of the planet formation process, and they can be used
as probes of the different mechanisms at play at this crucial time of
disk evolution. Latest research has shown, however, that TDs, which are usually
identified as disks showing evidence of an (at least partially)
evacuated inner dust hole, are in reality a diverse class of
objects. Some TDs have relatively small dust holes (a few AUs) and are
weakly accreting, if at all. On the other hand an apparently distinct
population of TDs show evidence for much larger inner dust cavities
(several to many tens of AU) and vigorous accretion, signifying that a
large amount of gas is present inside the dust cavity. Different
physical processes may be at play for the formation of different TD
types (e.g.\ photoevaporation, MHD processes, dust evolution, planet-disk interactions),
each being a piece of the complex planet formation puzzle. 

Until recently, observations of protoplanetary disks provided very few
constraints on our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation. That was in part due
to the lack of spatial resolution of telescope facilities at infrared and
(sub-)millimetre wavelengths, but also in part because protoplanetary disks
tend to be opaque, and therefore much of the planet formation process is
hidden from view. Both these obstacles impede an unobstructed view of the
physical processes happening inside these planetary nurseries. Both problems may now start to
be overcome with the enormous recent advances in the observational
facilities. At near infrared wavelengths and at millimetre wavelengths we
now start to obtain extraordinarily detailed images of these disks. They
turn out to feature complex (often non-axisymmetric) structures that
challenge our theoretical understanding of these disks. In particular,
many TDs show spectacular structures including lopsided blobs, rings,
spirals etc.\ It is suspected 
that some of these complex structures may be caused by newly formed giant
planets that gravitationally perturb the disk, but exciting new
alternative explanations, which not always involve planets are also emerging. 

In our proposed Research Unit we aim at studying various aspects of
TDs, leading to a better understanding of the different formation
mechanisms of this very diverse class of objects. TDs are
only now really becoming spatially resolvable thanks
to facilities like ALMA and VLT-SPHERE, making their study a timely and
urgent task. Only understanding the disk evolution and the planet-disk
interactions allow the large body of existing and planned observations to be
exploited to answer more complex questions like the formation of planetary
systems capable to host life. This requires a focussed effort from
several communities to devise a multi-pronged strategy to approach to
tackle the problem. Specifically, multiwavelength observations of disks at
different stages of evolution together with exoplanet and disk statistics
should be used to constrain a concerted theoretical modelling effort
including the hydrodynamics of the dust and gas component of disks, with and
without planets, joint to chemical and radiative transfer calculations,
particularly of the surface layers and winds of disks in (or just
before) the transition phase. This is the motivation for the proposed Research Unit.


\section{Introduction and motivation}

The question of whether the Earth may be a unique and special place for life
in our Universe has been the prime motivation for exoplanet finding missions
and continues to be the driving force behind many observational campaigns and
theoretical investigations in the field. While this question may have
partially been answered by the recent exoplanet surveys, which have shown
 that, statistically speaking, most stars in the Milky Way have planetary
  companions \citep{2012Natur.481..167C}, other surveys have
also highlighted the diversity of exoplanetary systems \citep{2015ApJS..217...31M}. 
The question however remains as to which
initial conditions may lead to the formation of planets. To answer
this question many more aspects of the planet formation process and of their
subsequent evolution must be understood.

Planets form from the dust and gas contained in the circumstellar disks surrounding nearly all young low- to intermediate-mass stars. These planet-forming disks are a by-product of the star-formation process, meaning that all stars have the potential to host a planetary system.
Circumstellar disks are observed to evolve and finally disperse over a
timescale of a few Myr, which is comparable to
the timescales for planet formation by the core accretion process
 and to migration timescales for giant planets
\citep[see][for a review]{2011ARA&A..49..195A}. This implies that the processes driving the
evolution and dispersal of disks play a crucial role in shaping new
planetary systems and likely contribute to the observed variety of exo-planets
\citep[see e.g.,]{2012MNRAS.422L..82A, 2015MNRAS.450.3008E}.

For the largest part
of their lives, the evolution of the surface density of disks seems to be well
described by simple viscous theory 
\citep[e.g.][]{1998ApJ...495..385H, 1974MNRAS.168..603L}.
This predicts a slow, homogeneous dispersal of the
disk. Observations, however, show that the dispersal is not a
continuous process: after having evolved viscously for a few million
years, disks regularly seem to disappear abruptly 
\citep[e.g.,][]{1995ApJS..101..117K, 2010ApJS..186..111L}.
Indeed studies have shown that the dispersal
timescales are about 10 times faster than the global disk lifetimes, and
that disks mostly disperse from the inside-out 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2011MNRAS.410..671E, 2013MNRAS.428.3327K}. 
`Transition Disks' (TDs), i.e.\ disks
that have an evacuated inner cavity in dust (or at least an inner region
which is severely depleted in optical depth), may be objects caught on
the last gasps of their lives and may thus provide key insights on the
mechanism responsible for their evolution. 

It is however becoming clear that transition disks, which are
identified observationally as having reduced near- to mid-infrared
emission,  are in reality a diverse class of objects. Some of them may
not actually be short-lived objects caught in the act of dispersing
their disks, but rather produced by a different rarer and longer lived
phenomenon 
\citep[see e.g.,][]{2016PASA...33....5O, 2016ApJ...825...77D}.
\begin{highlight}
It is of prime
importance to understand the physical processes leading to the
formation of rings, gaps and holes in planet forming disks, if these are to
be used as probes of disk dispersal and/or planet formation. This is
the overarching goal of this Research Unit. 
\end{highlight}

A number of theoretical models have been proposed for the origin of
transition disks, some of which are true disk-dispersal processes
(e.g.\ Photoevaporation: \citep{2001MNRAS.328..485C}; MRI-driven
winds: \citep{2009ApJ...691L..49S}; MHD winds: \citep{2016ApJ...821...80B}), 
while others
rather lead to dust-(and sometimes also gas)-depleted regions yielding
the observed infrared dip (e.g.\ Planet-disk interactions: 
\citep{2005ApJ...630L.185C}; dust grain growth: \citep{2005A&A...434..971D}; 
binary stars interactions: \citep{1992ApJ...395L.115M}), without necessarily leading to
the removal of the disk.  

Photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the central star is currently accepted as one of
the main players in the late evolution of disks and has seen several
dedicated theoretical efforts 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2001MNRAS.328..485C, 2006MNRAS.369..216A, 2008ApJ...688..398E,
2009ApJ...699.1639E, 2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O, 2012MNRAS.422.1880O,
2009ApJ...690.1539G, 2009ApJ...705.1237G, 2015ApJ...804...29G}.
Photoevaporation sets a crucial boundary condition to planet formation, 
putting an upper time limit to the formation of Gas Giant Planets, and 
possibly affecting the dust-to-gas ratio of the disk.
Photoevaporation is
successful in reproducing the observed dispersal timescales, the
inside-out mode of disk dispersal, and can reproduce a subset
($\sim$50\%) of the TD demographics around T-Tauri stars.

However, disk dispersal by photoevaporation, while certainly an important piece of the
puzzle, does not tell the whole story behind the formation of all
TDs. 

\begin{highlight}
Amongst the TD zoology, at least two separate classes seem
to have emerged, which we will refer to in this proposal as Type 1 and
Type 2 TDs. Type 1 TDs have small (a few AU) inner dust holes and show weak or no accretion of
gas onto the central star. Conversely, Type
2 TDs have much larger inner dust cavities (tens of AU) and show evidence of vigorous accretion ($\sim$10$^{-8}$
M$_{\odot}$/yr), with rates not too dissimilar from those measured
on primordial disks \citep[e.g.,][]{2014A&A...568A..18M}.
Type 2 TDs also tend to have high mm flux levels, meaning that
they still contain large amounts of material in their outer
regions. 
\end{highlight}
\citet{2012MNRAS.426L..96O} showed that it is statistically
unlikely that these two groups of objects may be drawn from the same
underlying population. When talking about TD demographics it is then
important to draw the distinction between the two types, as the
dominant formation mechanism is probably different.

Figure~\ref{fig-macc-rhole-mdisc} shows a collection of known accretion rates versus inner hole
radii for known TDs (Ercolano \& Pascucci, 2017, in prep.),
represented by circles. These are compared to photoevaporation model tracks from
\citet{2011MNRAS.412...13O}, grey squares, and the photoevaporation models plus giant planet
of \citet{2013MNRAS.430.1392R, 2015MNRAS.454.2173R}, grey lines. 
If stars of spectral type G or earlier (distinguishable by a light
blue circle in the figure) are excluded, about half of the global TD population consists of Type 1
disks. The formation of Type 1 TDs is generally well reproduced by
photoevaporation models \citep[e.g.,][]{2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O}.
The large accretion rates and large hole
radii of Type 2 TDs, on the other hand, are problematic for all 
photoevaporation models \citep[e.g.,][]{2013MNRAS.430.1392R, 2015MNRAS.454.2173R}
or grain
growth models \citep{2012A&A...544A..79B} to date, and the classical explanation is that
these objects may have instead been carved by dynamical interactions
with forming giant planets \citep[e.g.,][]{2011ApJ...729...47Z}. However, since the
current models based on the classic planet scenario also generally
fail to reproduce the Type 2 TD observations and 
their demographics \citep[see e.g.,][]{2016ApJ...825...77D},
a number of alternatives have recently been proposed which include magnetohydrodynamics
effects \citep[e.e.,][]{2016arXiv160907510W}, dust evolution 
\citep{2016A&A...585A..35P} and inner disk asymmetries \citep{2016ApJ...823L...8M}.
Figure~\ref{fig-type2-scat} shows a gallery of scattered light images of Type 2 TD.

ALMA now allows in some cases to measure the bulk of the molecular gas {\it
  directly}, showing than many Type 2 TDs have residual gas inside the
dust cavities \citep{2016A&A...585A..58V}, in agreement with the
planet scenario \citep[but see also][]{2016arXiv160907510W}.
Furthermore, spatially resolved observations of type
2 TDs have shown many bizarre features that are
not generally seen in primordial disks. For instance, they
  often display a huge dust ring \citep[e.g.,][]{2013Natur.493..191C}
  which is sometimes strongly lopsided 
  \citep[e.g.,][]{2013Sci...340.1199V}. The currently favored interpretation is that we see a
  key process of planet formation in action here: the mechanism of dust
  trapping in pressure maxima. Another spectacular kind of features often
  seen in TDs is spiral waves similar to those seen in galaxies
  \citep[e.g.,][see Fig.~\ref{fig-type2-scat}]{2012ApJ...748L..22M, 2015A&A...578L...6B, 2015ApJ...813L...2W}.
  Their origin is currently not
  understood, and trying to understand their physics may teach us about
important processes taking place in these disks. One interesting new
scenario, for example, was proposed to explain the bright ring of scattered light of
HD 142527 which has two dark spots on roughly opposite sides (see Fig.~\ref{fig-type2-scat}). 
\citet{2015ApJ...798L..44M} suggest that the shadows cast by an inclined small inner
disk could explain the location of the spots, implying that HD 142527
is an "inclined disk inside a disk". In that case, \citet{2016ApJ...823L...8M}
 claim that two shadows on opposite sides of the
bright rim may cause a brief pressure loss and be at the origin of the
m = 2 spiral waves. If confirmed this scenario opens a pandora of new
physical questions as to how could the inner disk have a different
rotation axis as the outer one?  \\

%{\bf What can we learn about Planet Formation from TDs? }\\
\subsection{What can we learn about Planet Formation from TDs? }

Both types of TDs can provide complementary information about the
planet formation process, if the observations can be interpreted
within a comprehensive theoretical framework. Type 1 TDs
can inform us about the disk dispersal mechanism, which influences the
physical conditions in the disk at the time of planet formation and
migration. Type 2 TDs, if indeed formed by dynamical interactions with
giant planets are direct witness of the planet formation
process. Importantly, all disk-destruction mechanisms essentially `open up' the
  disk, so that we can peek inside to see its inner workings, and see
  processes of planet formation in action. TDs therefore
  have the unique potential of unveiling key aspects of the planet formation
process.

As mentioned above, as well as disk morphology, the interplay between disk evolution and
dispersal and the planet formation process, of which both types of TDs
are a
by-product, is apparent on many other
 levels. For example the lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (a few
Myrs) are comparable to the timescales for planet formation via the core
accretion model. This highlights the relevance of studying disks at the end
of their lives (i.e.\ TDs), and highlights the importance
of the disk dispersal mechanism (e.g.\ photoevaporation) which sets the
physical conditions in the disk at the time of planet formation, and
also sets a time limit on the formation process of Gas Giant Planets. 
At the same time the similarity in the timescales for disk dispersal
and planet formation may also hint at the possibility that the planet
formation process plays a part in the final dispersal of the disks
\citep[e.g.][]{2013MNRAS.430.1392R, 2015MNRAS.454.2173R}.

matching the depth of the gaps (grey curve). The innermost disk
regions that are not well probed by the observations are masked. } 
\label{fig:twhya}
\end{figure}


The recent ALMA image of the disk around the young solar-like star TW~Hya is a prime example of a disk showing hints of
planets orbiting at tens of AU,  co-existing with a inner gap at 1~AU
which could have been 
recently created by photoevaporation \citep{2017MNRAS.464L..95E}. The ALMA image
is shown in the lef panel of Figure~\ref{fig:twhya} and was obtained by
a team including members of this Research Unit \citep{2016ApJ...820L..40A}. 
However both the existence of planets and the
photoevaporated gap remain speculative at present. As shown in the
right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:twhya}, current planet-disk interaction
models fail to reproduce the shape of the gaps as obtained from
scattered light observations taken with SPHERE \citep{2016arXiv161008939V}. 
Furthermore, while several spectral line observations exist
for TW Hya, the photoevaporation models do not yet have the predictive
power to directly measure the mass loss rate in the wind from
them. Until that becomes possible, even the nature of the gaps and
rings in 
the nearest and best studied of all (pre-)Transition Disks, remain
uncertain. 

As a final example of the direct influence of the inside-out disk dispersal
mechanism on the formation and evolution of planets, one should
consider 
the final architecture of
exo-planetary systems. While planet migration is necessary to explain
(e.g.) the presence of large planets close to the central star, the
so-called ``hot Jupiters'', this process alone cannot explain the pile-up and
deserts in the semi-major axis distribution of exoplanets 
\citep[see also][]{2014ApJ...780...53C, 2015ApJ...798L..32C}. An
additional planet-parking mechanism is required, which may be provided by (e.g.)
photoevaporation which opens a gap in the disk, forming a TD and
stopping further planet migration \citep[e.g.,][]{2012MNRAS.422L..82A, 
2015MNRAS.450.3008E}.

%\subsubsection{Rings, gaps and holes in planet-forming disks}
\subsubsection{Multi-Ringed Disks}
\label{sec-multi-ringed-disks}
The last few months, since the submission of the pre-proposal of this
Research Unit, have seen an important observationally-driven development: it
is becoming increasingly clear that multi-ringed structures may be
ubiquitous in disks, regardless of their age and/or evolutionary stage
classification (i.e.\ full disks or TDs). Obvious examples are the young
(about 1 Myr) and massive HL Tau disk \citep{2015ApJ...808L...3A} and the
old (about 10 Myr) and evolved TW Hya disk \citep{2016ApJ...820L..40A,
  2016arXiv161008939V}. Both object show bright rings alternated by darker
areas, which could be a signature of planet formation (although note that
the features in the two objects show some differences). The detection of
ringed structures in very young disks is leading the community to abandon
the classical concept of a `proto-planetary' disk (i.e.\ a disk that exists
before the planets form), but rather embrace the concept of `planet-forming'
disks, to highlight that the planet-formation process happens throughout a
disk's lifetime.

Apart from nomenclature the ubiquity of ringed structures suggests a strong
link with disk evolution. As an example, if the gaps at 22 AU and 37 AU in
the disk of TW Hya, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:twhya}, have indeed been
created by planets \citep[but see also][]{2016arXiv161008939V}, then one can
expect the flow of gas into the inner disk to be reduced. A reduction of the
accretion rate in the inner disk, favours the onset of photoevaporation
\citep[e.g.][]{2013MNRAS.430.1392R, 2015MNRAS.454.2173R}, and indeed TW Hya
also has a deep gap at 1~AU, which we have shown to be consistent with being
photoevaporative in nature \citep{2017MNRAS.464L..95E}.

While the ringed HL Tau disk was already known before our pre-proposal and
the rings in TW Hydra were just being published around the time of
submission, only recently the ubiquity of such ``Multi-Ringed Disks'' has
become evident. In addition to HL Tau and TW Hydra, multiple rings have
since been found in ALMA data of HD 163296 \citep{Isella2016} and Elias 24
(Carpenter et al.~in prep). And in near-infrared scattered light images
rings were very recently discovered in BP Piscium
\citep{2017MNRAS.466L...7D}, HR 97048 \citep{2016A&A...595A.112G} and PDS 66
\citep{2016ApJ...818L..15W}. Some Transition Disks also show such
multi-ringed structures in their outer disk: TW Hydra
\citep{2016arXiv161008939V}, V4046 Sgr \citep{2015ApJ...803L..10R} and HD
169142 \citep{2015PASJ...67...83M}, which suggests that TDs and Multi-Ringed
Disks are somehow related, or at least have overlapping members.

It has therefore become clear that a study of the gaps and holes found in
TDs would thus not be complete without an investigation of the
possible nature of ringed structures in all disks. As well as through planet-disk
interactions, bright and dark rings can also be created by dust traps,
chemical effects, snowlines, radiative transfer effects and other
mechanisms. It now appears to be increasingly evident that if we wish to
study TDs to seek for indications of disk evolution and ongoing planet
formation using our theoretical modelling strategy, it would be unwise
to leave this new class of objects out of our scope. Many of the processes of
dust radial drift, dust trapping, planet-disk interaction and gap formation,
which we will numerically model in this RU, 
also readily apply to Multi-Ringed Disks. It is therefore straightforward to expand
our methodology to this new class of objects, and it opens new
possibilities for finding clues to disk evolution and evidence for planet
formation processes at work in these disks.

The co-speaker of this RU is in fact one of the PIs of an ALMA Large Programme on
Multi-Ringed Disks (Andrews, Perez, Dullemond \& Isella, ALMA proposal ID
2016.1.00484.L), which was ranked A, so we expect a large flood of data
starting around the summer of 2017. 

Several projects in this Research Unit (in particular projects A1 and D1)
have been expanded, compared to their pre-proposal version, to include
multi-ringed structures more explicitly, as a response to these latest
developments in spatially resolved observations.

\subsection{Why is a Research Unit on TDs needed Now?}
%
 From the above argumentation it becomes clear that TDs and Multi-Ringed
 Disks are
  unique laboratory experiments created by Nature that allow us to test and
  update our understanding of disk structure and evolution as well as planet
  formation processes on the small scale (dust growth and dynamics) and
  large scale (planet assembly and planet-disk interaction). 

New observational facilities including ALMA and VLT-SPHERE are revolutionising our view of
these objects. We are now starting to obtain extraordinarily detailed images of these objects at infrared and
millimetre wavelengths. 
The richness of patterns seen in TDs (rings, spirals, shadows, vortices, etc.)\
has made TDs popular as prime targets for new observational campaigns, whenever
new modes of observation become available. They are thus
among the best-observed galactic objects with these new facilities.
% While the new observations are fundamental to pin down many important
% characteristics of the dust and gas density distribution in the bulk of
% these disks or in their cavities, the disk atmospheres and winds, which bear the signature of the dispersal mechanism, are
% best traced by high resolution observations of emission line profiles. 
% As well as a number of surveys
% which are in course on the VLT in the optical, the mid-infrared region will also see a wealth of new
% data with the upgrade for the CRIRES instrument, which has an an expected delivery date of 2019.
Also the observational study of the disk dispersal mechanism is advancing. 
The tenuous gas inside the cavity and in the photoevaporation-driven
wind can be studied with high resolution observations of emission line profiles.
Surveys of such wind-sensitive lines in the optical are on-going on the VLT.
And with the newly refurbished CRIRES+ to be commissioned in 2019, 
a wealth of new data in the near-infrared is expected.

\begin{highlight}
  A solid theoretical framework is now urgently needed in order to
  interpret these new observations and decode the message encrypted in the
  spectral and continuum emission of TDs and Multi-Ringed Disks.
\end{highlight}

The time is clearly ripe for a multi-pronged, yet concerted theoretical
effort with the aim of finding out what these Transitional Disks can teach
us about disk physics. The new models to be developed in this Research Unit are exactly
what is needed at this stage.

With such an approach, TDs offer a unique chance to test and improve our
understanding of the environment in which planets form.  This, in turn,
allows us to better estimate the boundary/environmental/initial conditions
for models for the formation and evolution of planetary systems. This is
particularly current with the newly installed DFG Schwerpunktprogramm SPP
1992 ``Exploring the Diversity of Extrasolar Planets''. In that SPP the
exoplanets and their formation processes are studied, but the structure,
evolution and destruction of the protoplanetary disks in which these planet
formation processes take place are explicitly excluded from the SPP. This
Research Unit can therefore provide crucial new physical insights to several
SPP project regarding the birth environments of planets.
% are reaching new
%levels of complexity, but they remain limited due to the current uncertainties in the boundary/initial
%conditions inherent to uncertain disk physics.

%  
  
To be able to understand the observed features and statistics of these
fascinating Transitional Discs, we envision a concerted but broadly based
theoretical/numerical modeling effort, combining the theory of disk
structure, evolution and destruction with chemistry, dust growth and
dynamics, as well as with planet-disk interaction and gas dynamics.

\begin{highlight}
  It can therefore not be done in a single or a set of DFG individual
  proposal, but requires a concerted, closely knit small network of projects
  involving several teams, covering the key observational and theoretical
  skills.
\end{highlight}

To make the link to the observations of these disks and their winds, which
are typically done in scattered light (optical/IR), dust thermal emission
(sub-millimetre), molecular rotational lines (sub-millimetre) and, for the
winds, in atomic and molecular rovibrational lines (optical/near-infrared),
our effort has to also include modeling of disk chemistry and radiative
transfer. Finally, although this Research Unit puts strong emphasis on
modeling, we also need projects that are dedicated to collecting and
processing the latest data, and collaborate with the theoretical teams to
link theory and observation.

% as well as team members with detailed understanding of the
% observations and their limitations. 

%This is the motivation of the composition of the Research Unit we propose here.


\section{Contribution of this team to the field }
%
%The process of planet formation cannot be observed directly and
%therefore theories of planet formation theories are built using the
%indirect constraints provided by the observable consequences of
%planet formation on the structure and evolution of protoplanetary
%disks, in particular TDs. Indeed recent ALMA
%observations of disks have provided many surprises posing new
%challenges to existing theories of (e.g.) dust aggregation and
%retention, protoplanetary disk dispersal and planet-disk interactions
%and migration. One of the most famous examples is the image of the
%relatively young disk around HL Tau, which already shows a multiple
%ring structure, speculated to be due to planets forming. Transition
%disks are indeed the best laboratories to study these processes,
%which are all likely to play a role in their formation. 
%On the theory side our team includes
%dynamicists, experts in radiative transfer and astrochemistry, who are
%committed to exploit the synergies of the team to provide a holistic
%approach to understanding planet formation and disk evolution, via the
%study of TDs and their formation. \\

Our team is composed by theorists and observers, who have all
contributed significantly to the state-of-the art of the field today. 
On the theory side our team includes
dynamicists, experts in radiative transfer, dust evolution and astrochemistry, who are
committed to exploit the synergies of the team to provide a holistic
approach to understanding planet formation and disk evolution, via the
study of TDs and their formation. On the observational side our
team includes experts in protoplanetary disk observations (both
ALMA and VLT), as well as observations of the host stars.\\

{\it Speaker: }{\bf Prof.\ Barbara Ercolano (LMU)} has been studying the link between high
energy radiation from the central star and disk evolution and
dispersal \citep[e.g.,][]{2008ApJ...688..398E, 2009ApJ...699.1639E,
2010MNRAS.401.1415O, 2011MNRAS.412...13O, 2012MNRAS.422.1880O}. 
Before \citet{2009ApJ...699.1639E}, the importance
of X-ray radiation from the central star on the dispersal of disks had
not been recognised. This process is now accepted as one of the major
player for disk dispersal, hence setting the timescale for planet
formation. The models have been tested against observables
\citep[e.g.][]{2010MNRAS.406.1553E, 2013MNRAS.434.3378O, 2013MNRAS.428.3327K,
2015MNRAS.452.3689E}, producing
several successes, but also opening new questions 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2016MNRAS.460.3472E}, such as those to be
approached as part of the projects proposed here. Prof.\ Ercolano and
her team have also investigated the effects of X-ray irradiation on
the final parking radius of exoplanets \citep{2015MNRAS.450.3008E}, as
well as on the intrinsic \citep{2013MNRAS.436.3446E, 2013ApJ...764...65M}
and observed
accretion properties of protoplanetary disks \citep{2014MNRAS.439..256E}. 
With the work of \citet{2013MNRAS.430.1392R, 2015MNRAS.454.2173R} 
the interaction between planet formation and photoevaporation was first
taken into account, in an attempt to match TDs
statistics. Together with Dr.\ Testi, she recently published a Letter
showing that the innermost gap in the closest planet-making disk to
Earth, TW Hya, could be the first photoevaporative gap
imaged. Prof.\ Ercolano is also the main author of the dust RT and 
photoionisation code {\sc mocassin} (Ercolano et al. 2003, 2005,
2008b), which is one of the main tools
used for the subpojects in area B. This code includes X-ray processes
and was recently ported to Voronoi grids \citep{2016MNRAS.456..756H}. 
For the development of {\sc
  mocassin} Prof.\ Ercolano received the Royal Astronomical Society
Fowler Prize for early career achievements in 2010 (https://www.ras.org.uk/news-and-press/157-news2010/1713-ras-honours-outstanding-astronomers-and-geophysicists). \\

{\it Co-Speaker:} {\bf Prof.\ Cornelis Dullemond (ZAH)} is an expert in modeling the radiative transfer in protoplanetary
disks, to compute the (vertical) disk structure and the disk's appearance as seen
by observational facilities. He is the author of the popular open source RADMC-3D 
radiative transfer modeling package, which he and his team employ to study
protoplanetary disks, and linking models to observations at infrared and submillimetre
wavelengths. He develops new methods for disk modeling, and has been involved
in the development of new radiation hydrodynamics modules for the PLUTO code
\citep{2010A&A...511A..81K} and ZEUS \citep{2015A&A...574A..81R}. His group has also played a
leading role in global disk modeling with dust growth and drift 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2008A&A...480..859B, 2008A&A...489..931Z, 2010A&A...513A..56G,
2010A&A...513A..57Z, 2009A&A...503L...5B, 2010A&A...513A..79B}, 
the subsequent planetesimal formation 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2010Icar..210..507O, 2012A&A...544L..16W, 2014A&A...572A..78D}, 
and the link between the disk/dust models and millimetre
and infrared disk observations 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2012A&A...538A.114P, 2013Sci...340.1199V,
2016ApJ...820...54K, 2016ApJ...831L..12K}. 
A key theme in the research of Dullemond's group is the study 
of physical processes and how we can constrain them with observations. The
group often develops its own methods of computation and own codes to implement
the new physics in existing models, and thereby opening new
directions. \\

{\it Applicant:} {\bf Prof.\ Wilhelm Kley (University of T\"ubingen}) is an expert in computational astrophysics with emphasis on the
planet formation process, starting from the growth of small dust grains all the way
to full grown planets. The numerical methods developed and used in his group range 
from molecular dynamics, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based 
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) including radiative transport. These methods will be used
in the theoretical modeling within the Research Group.   
One focus of his research has been on the important planet-disk
interaction. Through multi-dimensional (2D and 3D) radiation hydrodynamical simulations
his group demonstrated the possibility of strongly reduced or even outward migration
\citep{2008A&A...487L...9K, 2009A&A...506..971K}. Recently, models for the origin of the
circumbinary planets have been presented \citep{2014A&A...564A..72K}. Here, longterm models of
disks in the presence of a central binary have been simulated and the motion of an embedded
planet has been followed. Concerning the main focus of this research group, 
\citet{2013A&A...560A..40M} constructed time-dependent hydrodynamics models of transitional disks induced by the
presence of a single planet. Specifically, the models investigated the amount of gas flow past
the planet into the inner hole as a function of the planet mass, disk
parameter and stellar irradiation. With \citet{2015A&A...584A.110P}
significant advances were made in the understanding of the dust phase
response to planet-disk interactions. \\

{\it Applicant:} {\bf Prof.\ Paola Caselli (MPE)} 
% moved to MPE as Director of the new Centre
%for Astrochemical Studies in April 2014, after spending almost seven
%years as Professor of Astronomy at the School of Physics and Astronomy
%at the University of Leeds, UK. She
is an expert on astrochemical
modelling and observations of the earliest phases of star and planet
formation. She has made important contributions on the chemical structure
of pre-stellar cores (within which future stellar systems form.)
%finding that: CO molecules are almost completely ($>$90\%) frozen onto
%dust grain surfaces in the central few thousand astronomical units
%(Caselli et al. 1999), thus thick CO-ice mantles are predicted to be
%present just before a protostar is born; deuterated molecules are the
%best diagnostic tools of the physical properties of the central
%regions, the future stellar cradles (Caselli et al. 2002, 2008;
%Crapsi, Caselli et al. 2005, 2007); the tenuous UV field produced by
%cosmic-ray impacts with H$_2$ molecules plays an important role in
%producing water vapour and regulating the gas-solid phase in these
%dense and cold phases preceding star formation (Caselli et al. 2012);
%a dust opacity increase toward the pre-stellar core centre is needed
%to reproduce the observed temperature drop (Keto \& Caselli 2010),
%suggesting that dust grains have already started to coagulate;
%quasi-static contraction best reproduces the observed molecular line
%profiles toward one of the best studied pre-stellar cores (Keto,
%Caselli \& Rawlings 2015), showing in this case that the dynamical
%evolution toward protostellar birth is a slow process, maybe regulated
%by the action of magnetic fields in partially ionised media. 
She is
now focusing on the link between molecular clouds and protoplanetary
disks using high angular resolution observations, hydro- and
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations, which incorporate various degrees
of chemical complexity, and radiative transfer codes. She is
interested in understanding the effects of different initial
conditions in the physical and chemical evolution of protoplanetary
disks. Already published work in this field include the chemical
structure and ALMA observability of a self-gravitating disk orbiting
around a protostar which will likely evolve into a future F-type main
sequence star \citep{2011MNRAS.417.2950I, 2013MNRAS.433.2064D}
as well as the
chemical evolution of a self-gravitating disk surrounding a
protosolar-type star \citep{2015MNRAS.453.1147E}. 
%; all this work on young disks
%has been done with students and former students from the University of
%Leeds, partially funded by the ERC grant PALs 320620).
%Self-gravitating disks are thought to be important during the earliest
%phases of protostellar evolution, although their existence still need
%to be confirmed with ALMA.  
Using non-ideal MHD simulations of contracting dense cloud cores, 
she recently found that the disappearance of very small grains (VSGs), 
due to accretion onto larger grains, enables the formation of 
protoplanetary disks \citep{2016MNRAS.460.2050Z}. This is due to the fact 
that VSGs dominate the coupling of the bulk neutral matter with magnetic 
fields, thus allowing an efficient loss of angular momentum (via magnetic 
breaking) in regions where protoplanetary disks should form. Together 
with plasma physicists, she also started a detail study of dust grain 
charging and its effect on dust coagulation \citep{2015ApJ...812..135I}.
Her expertise on basic astrochemical
processes will be applied to the available and future dynamical models
of transition disks. \\

\textit{Applicant:} \textbf{Dr.\ Tilman Birnstiel (LMU starting in 02/2017)} has been
studying the crucial early stages of planet formation by simulating growth,
destruction, and global transport processes in disk
\citep[e.g.][]{2010A&A...513A..79B}. While some of the transport processes have
been proposed in the 70s, they were often neglected as they seemed incompatible
with observations of disks. Birnstiels models were the first to show, that these
processes are not only consistent with many observations but are necessary to
explain and understand the evolution of disks \citep{2010A&A...516L..14B}. His
models successfully explained or even predicted observed signatures of growth
and transport processes: the spectral index behavior predicted in
\citet{2010A&A...516L..14B} was observed in \citet{2012ApJ...760L..17P},
\citet{2016A&A...588A..53T} and others. Small scale pressure traps were needed
to explain the integrated continuum emission properties of disks
\citep{2012A&A...538A.114P}, which strikingly resemble the observations of
\citet{2015ApJ...808L...3A} and \citet{2016ApJ...820L..40A}. Sharp dust edges in
protoplanetary disks as predicted in \citet{2014ApJ...780..153B} are now seen in
almost every observation that has high enough resolution and sensitivity
\citep[e.g.][]{2016ApJ...820L..40A,2013A&A...557A.133D}. Lately, for the first
time, signatures of his predicted effect of dust accumulation inside the water
snow line \citet{2010A&A...513A..79B} have been detected in
\citet{2016Natur.535..258C}. His models have substantial impact on the further
evolution of planet formation via a range of effects: they provide the
``pebbles'' for pebble accretion, they predict how the planet forming material
is redistributed within the disk, they determine the continuum opacity and
therefore the temperature and observational appearance of disks, they feed the
planetesimal formation factories and transport key volatile species along the
way and finally they provide the surface area for chemical reactions that determine the
chemical composition of the disk. To investigate these links to planet formation
and to the disks chemical composition, he has been awarded an ERC starting grant
that starts in March 2017, is hosted at the LMU, and perfectly complements
the goals and work plan of this research group proposal.\\

 On the observational side our group includes experts on the
 observations of young stellar objects, transition disks, initial stages of
 planet formation and planet disk interactions.Our observational team
 is experienced with state-of-the art observational facilities
 including: ALMA, IRAM-NOEMA and the VLA (continuum and spectroscopic
 interferometric observations) as well as optical/infrared high
 contrast imaging and spectroscopy using the LBT and the VLT
 instruments (in particular, but not limited to, XShooter and
 SPHERE).\\ 

{\it Applicant:} {\bf Dr.\ Leonardo Testi (ESO)}, has accumulated years of expertise
in the observation and analysis of young stars and their protoplanetary
disks at infrared and millimetre wavelengths. He has investigated the initial stages of planet formation via
extensive studies of properties and evolution of dust in disks 
\citep{2003A&A...403..323T, 2014prpl.conf..339T}. 
With his group at ESO has completed the first large observational surveys for dust growth
in disks \citep{2010A&A...512A..15R, 2010A&A...521A..66R}
and has developed the first self-consistent analysis tool to constrain dust properties
as a function of radius in disks \citep{2011A&A...525A..12B, 2013A&A...558A..64T, 
2016A&A...588A..53T}.
His group also developed the methodology to perform accurate measurements of
the photospheric properties and accretion rates from broad-band XShooter
spectra \citep{2013A&A...551A.107M} and applied it to study the correlation
between disk properties and mass accretion rates in young stars with disks
\citep{2016A&A...591L...3M}.
His current role as European ALMA Programme Scientist at ESO
puts him in a very favourable position to lead an effort here in
building a systematic catalogue of the available ALMA observations and help with the interpretation of these data in terms of
the models. The new observational
campaigns that we foresee for phase 2 of the Research Unit will also
strongly 
benefit from his guidance. \\

{\it Applicant:} {\bf Prof.\ Thomas Preibisch (LMU)}  has many years of experience in the
fields of stellar X-ray astronomy and infrared observations
of young stellar clusters.
He was deeply involved in the
Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project \citep[COUP, see][]{2005ApJS..160..401P},
the Chandra Carina Complex Project \citep[CCCP, see][]{2011ApJS..194...10P},
and numerous other projects where
the identification of the X-ray sources with optical
and infrared counterparts was a crucial step for the studies
of the relation between the X-ray properties and the stellar/circumstellar
properties of the young stars. He has also performed several large-scale 
surveys of star forming
regions in the near-infrared \citep[e.g.,][]{2011ApJS..194...10P,
2014A&A...572A.116P}
and far-infrared regime \citep[e.g.,][]{2012A&A...541A.132P}
with the aim to identify protostars and study disk-bearing young
stellar objects.\\

on the VLT SPHERE disk programme and therefore has prime access to
high-contrast high-resolution scattered light images of Transition
Disks. He has been involved in many protoplanetary disk projects, both
observationally and theoretically. He is co-author of the 
\citet{1997Icar..128..213K} paper predicting the role of dust trapping in vortices
in protoplanetary disks, something which has recently been 
observationally confirmed in transition disks. 
His involvement in this

has focussed on studying Transition Disks with ALMA. In 2013 her team
published the first strong evidence, based on ALMA data, for a
dust-trapping vortex in the Transition disk Oph IRS 48 \citep{2013Sci...340.1199V}
and in 2016 her team found wide-spread
 evidence for dense molecular gas inside dust cavities \citep{2016A&A...585A..58V}. 
She has been
involved in many protoplanetary disk studies, both observationally as
well as from an astrochemical perspective. Her involvement in this Forschergruppe
will be through discussions/collaboration on the modeling and through comparison with
 observations of the gas surface density structure. She does not apply for

\section{Scientific Objectives}

Planet formation and disk evolution feed back on each other. Indeed
the formation and migration of planets in protoplanetary disks is
clearly affected by the structure and the physical properties of the
disk itself \citep[e.g.][to cite only a few of the works coming from our team]{2016arXiv161101070D, 2015MNRAS.450.3008E}. 
The
structure and evolution of the disk, however, can be also deeply
influenced by the planet formation process, as demonstrated by our
recent calculations \citep[e.g.,][]{2013MNRAS.430.1392R, 2015MNRAS.454.2173R}.

This has important consequences both in the interpretation of the observed
exo-planet properties (eg. size and semi-major axis distributions) as
well as in the interpretation of the disk structures, which are often
used as tell-tale signs for planet formation, as in the case of the
TDs. Our understanding of how the two processes
influence each other is however still incomplete, but it can be
improved by studying the physical process behind the formation of all
different types of TDs . 
In this Research Unit we aim at achieving a more complete picture of
planet formation and disk evolution by means of an interdisciplinary
approach to tackle a number of important outstanding questions. 
\\

\begin{highlight}
How can we use TDs as direct witnesses of the planet formation process?
\end{highlight}
\begin{compactitemize}
\item[--] Which TDs are carved by planets and which are a result of disk evolution? 
\item[--] What do the complex shapes of TDs (rings, blobs, spirals) teach us about the physical and
dynamical processes taking place in protoplanetary disks?
\item[--] How does dust evolve and travel within disks to form planet(esimal)s?
\end{compactitemize}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{highlight}
How can we use TDs to learn about the disk dispersal mechanism?
\end{highlight}
\begin{compactitemize}
\item[--] What are the mass loss rates of the disk wind and
  what parameter space in the TD demographics can thus be reproduced
  by photoevaporation?
\item[--] What are the dust and gas surface density
  distributions in TDs and how can they be
  explained?
\item[--] How does the high-energy emission from the central
  star regulate disk accretion and dispersal, leading to the formation
  of different types of TDs?
\item[--] Are Type 1 and Type 2 TDs really disjoint groups, caused by 
  different physical processes?
\end{compactitemize} 
\vspace{1em}

To answer these questions we will use the following approach: 

\begin{itemize}
\item
\begin{Emphasize}
  Investigate observationally the accretion properties and the distributions
  of dust and gas in the disks and winds of primordial compared to
  transition objects.
\end{Emphasize}
To this aim a systematic catalogue of observations will be built, 
which will provide the constraints to the modelling efforts described below. 
\item
\begin{Emphasize}
  Dust trapping and growth in TDs.
\end{Emphasize}
Dust and
gas hydrodynamical models of disks with and without cavities will be produced to match the
constraints from the observations. Dust motion and growth will be self-consistently
modeled, linking both to observations and to planet formation.  
%This modelling will put constraints onto the
%planet-disk interaction and photoevaporation models described below. 
\item
\begin{Emphasize}
  Planet-disk interaction and envelope infall models.
\end{Emphasize}
These models will aim at reproducing
observations of (mainly) Type 2 TDs and Multi-Ringed Discs, 
including their accretion properties, 
to pin down the formation mechanism of the observed huge inner cavities,
ongoing accretion flows, rings, and asymmetric structures in these disks.
\item
\begin{Emphasize}
  Modelling of photoevaporative winds.
\end{Emphasize}
By modelling the chemistry and dust entrainment of photoevaporative winds
we will be able to predict observables of these winds, allowing a comparison
to observations.
\item
\begin{Emphasize}
  Determine the mass loss-rates of photoevaporative winds to pin down the
  mechanism producing Type 1 TDs.
\end{Emphasize}
Using the models of photoevaporative winds, appropriate wind diagnostics 
will be identified, comparing primordial to
TDs. Existing archival observations will be used at first to compare
with the models and a new observing campaign with ALMA will be
devised, perhaps spilling into the second funding period of the Research Unit.
\item
\begin{Emphasize}
  Determine the dominant dispersal mechanism.
\end{Emphasize}
We will
use the archival observations and our newly developed models to analyse
an initial sample of disks, the final statistics will be achieved
however in the second funding period, where a population synthesis of
TDs will be attempted.
\item 
\begin{Emphasize}
  Close the loop using mass loss rates, central star properties and
  accretion measurements to calibrate models.
\end{Emphasize}
At this
point the models will have significantly less free parameters and can
be used to extract the initial conditions for planet formation
(e.g.\ mass, turbulence in evolved disks). This will make use of the new state-of-the
art simulations and a homogeneous sample of accretion rates and central
star properties including X-ray data.

\subsection{Overview over the Research Unit}
%
The main goal of this Research Unit is to understand the morphology,
spectroscopy and demographics of TDs, in order to answer
basic questions about the planet formation process. We propose a
four-pronged coordinated effort which includes (A) Observational
studies; (B) disk dispersal models; (C) Dust physics; (D) Planet-disk
interaction models. The division in subfields is not strict and is
only given here in the aid of clarity. Subfields often overlap and/or
feed back on each other, highlighting the need of strong
collaborations as proposed here. The observations will provide the
constraints to be simultaneously met by models developed in the other
areas. Our team is supported by several external collaborators in particular
Prof.\ T.\ Henning (MPIA) and Prof.\ E.\ van Dishoeck (MPE/Leiden) have
agreed to take an active part in our project. The theoretical models in the three theory subfields require
expertise in hydrodynamics, astrochemistry, dust evolution and
radiative transfer, which is available in our team. The specific
projects in each area, the support required and the respective key members
of the team are summarised in Table \ref{table-overview-ru}.

%Figure \ref{fig-diagram-links} shows schematically the direct links between
%the listed projects, which provide the foundation for the Phase 2
%study. 
%\todo{Kees to Barbara: What is the phase 2 study, and why do the
%  links provide the basis for that?} 
Details about some of the major links between
projects are summarised in what follows.\\

%

\noindent\underline{{\bf\AreacolA Area A: Observations}}\\
\noindent The projects in area A both aim at obtaining
observational constraints on the dust and gas properties of
protoplanetary disks and their central stars. Project A1 focusses on
collecting and analysing existing ALMA data and complementing those
with additional ALMA, VLA and high-contrast infrared imaging observations. 
The aim is to characterize the content and properties of solids and gas in TDs 
and to compare with the demographical properties of evolving disk populations. 
Evidence for dust and gas evolution, including grain growth,
and planet-disk interactions will be characterised in order to provide
direct observational tests of planet formation and dispersal theories,
necessary to interpret the observational appearance of Type 1 and 2
TDs. The focus of project A2 is on the central star properties and
their relation to the accretion properties of the disk, which may be
modulated by the disk dispersal mechanisms that lead to the formation
of TDs. While both of these projects have self-contained aims, they
will also provide the observational goalposts for the theoretical
investigations of all projects in areas B, C and D, and indeed a
legacy for future theoretical studies of this kind also by other
groups.

\
\mbox{}\vspace{1em}\\
\noindent\underline{\bf\AreacolB Area B: disk dissipation and chemistry }\\
\noindent The main objective of the projects in area B is to
determine the mass loss rates in disk winds, and constrain once and
for all the disk dissipation mechanisms, leading to the formation of
Type 1 TDs. This is crucial to interpret the observed Type 1
demographics. We will perform quantitative spectroscopical modelling
of disk winds, identifying and using new wind diagnostics, in
particular comparing primordial and TDs. In project B1 we will develop
the most comprehensive radiation-hydrodynamics models of
photoevaporative disk winds to date. The physics beyond the X-ray
heated layer will be accounted for for the first time. This will be
achieved by coupling the (radiation-)hydrodynamics code PLUTO to an efficient 
chemical solver for a reduced network,
developed in project B2. Project B2 aims at producing a detailed astrochemical model of the
disk atmosphere and its wind. By means of radiative transfer
calculations a synthetic spectrum will be obtained to be compared with
state-of-the-art observation of spectrally resolved emission from
disks, particularly those with known cavities (TDs). The intensity and
profiles of emission lines tracing the base of the wind will allow us
to put constraints on the wind-launching mechanism, responsible for
the dispersal of the disks.  

Both projects will use existing and new observational
constraints coordinated in projects A1 and A2, and also provided by
our external collaborators. The dust 
content of the wind which is of prime importance for the chemical
modelling will be provided by project C2. Projects C1 and D1 will
inform us on dust traps and 
planet-disk
interactions which affect the underlying disk evolution and may help
photoevaporation create gaps and holes at 
earlier times (see e.g. Rosotti et al 2013, 2015).\\ 

%
\mbox{}\vspace{1em}\\
\noindent\underline{\bf\AreacolC Area C: Dust Physics}\\
\noindent The dynamics and evolution of dust grains in disks is the
main subjects of area C. In project C1 we will study the growth and
trapping of dust grains at hotspots in TDs that may lead
to breaking through the meter-size barrier of radial drift, thus
allowing the formation of planetesimals. We will use hydrodynamical
modelling and dust coagulation models as well as 3D 
radiative transfer tools. Furthermore, we will be able to use the
observational sample collected and analysed in project A1 to tackle
fundamental open questions on the first stages of planet
formation. This project will feedback and take inputs from the
photoevaporation modelling performed in project B1 and it will
eventually produce
the underlying dust distributions for project C2, which aims at
determining the dust content of photoevaporative winds. The latter
will make use of state-of-the art models of photoevaporating
primordial and TDs from project B1 as well as inputs for the dust distributions from
project C1, in order to constrain dust entrainment in the wind, which
is an important input to the chemical models in project B2. Finally,
project C1 would highly benefit from the setups and methods developed
in the more detailed models of Area D.\\ 


%\pagebreak[4]


\mbox{}\vspace{1em}\\
\noindent\underline{\bf\AreacolD Area D: Planet-disk interactions}\\
\noindent Projects in area D aim at constructing realistic
simulations of planet-disk interactions and studying the dynamical processes
leading to non-axisymmetric features in order to explain the wealth of new
and intriguing observations of TDs. The overarching goal is to use
these observation-constrained (from project A1) models to pin down
the important details of the disk interaction processes. This is of
fundamental importance to be able to disentangle the message about
planet formation which is locked in TDs observations. In particular
project D1 aims at significantly pushing forward the state-of-the art
of (radiation)-hydrodynamical models of gap-forming giant planets
embedded in disks including dust dynamics. 
This project will provide important inputs of
gas and dust density distributions for project B1, particularly informing about the
fate of dust grains at planet-gaps, which is also relevant to project
C1. Project D2 aims at explaining the surprising non-axisymmetric
structures recently observed with ALMA in a number of TDs, via
detailed hydrodynamical and radiative transfer models, which will also
account for realistic grain size distributions from project
C1. Studying the intriguing nature of these objects is likely to
provide important insights on planet-disk interaction processes, thus
enabling us to use these disks as proxies for planet formation.  \\

projects. The connections are marked as light green - moderate - or

Research Unit can be found in the description of the individual
projects.  }
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The connection Matrix}
\label{sub-matrix}
Figure~\ref{fig-matrix} summarises the connections visually in a
colour matrix. The strong/moderate connections are marked with
dark/light green. A brief summary of the project connections is
included here, while a more detailed description can be found in the
individual project descriptions. Note that the matrix is symmetric, XY connection = YX
connection, thus only XY connections are described below.   \\
\begin{Emphasize} A1-A2 \end{Emphasize} The 
data-sets from projects A1 and A2 complement each other allowing a
constraining comparison with synthetic disk
populations obtained from the models developed in project B1 and B2,
on the hydrodynamics and chemistry of photoevaporative winds,
respectively. \\
\begin{Emphasize} A1-B1 \& A1-B2 \end{Emphasize} The demographical properties of gas in disks
derived in this project in combination 
with the outcome of project A2, providing data on accretion and
stellar properties, will
be an essential asset for determining the initial conditions and constraints
for the models developed as part of projects B1, on the radiation-hydrodynamics, and
B2, on the chemistry of photoevaporative winds.\\
\begin{Emphasize} A1-C1 \& A1-C2 \end{Emphasize} 
The dust properties in disks from project A1 
will provide  key benchmarks for the models mainly developed in
project C1, which focusses on dust evolution in pressure traps. The
data will
also help constrain the initial conditions in the underlying dust
disks for models developed in project C2, which focusses on dust grain
entrainment in photoevaporative winds. \\
\begin{Emphasize} A1-D1 \end{Emphasize} One of the tasks
in project A1 is to study observationally the 
evolution of the detailed physical properties of disks with embedded
planets. The data will provide important constraints to models of planet-disk
interactions carried out in project D1. Specifically, the data will
constrain the model 
predictions for the development of rings, gaps and holes in (dust and
gas) disks. \\
\begin{Emphasize}  A2-B1 \& A2-B2 \& A2-C2 \end{Emphasize} This project will collect
and (re-)derive X-ray and accretion properties 
from a large number of sources. These will be used as inputs for the models
developed in projects B1, B2 and C2, treating, respectively,
radiation-hydrodynamics, astrochemistry and dust entrainment in
photoevaporation models of disks. The statistical analysis of the
data from this project, together with the gas and dust demographics
obtained from project A2, will allow a direct comparison with synthetic disk
populations obtained from the models developed in project B1, which
will provide the latter with important constraints. \\
\begin{Emphasize}  B1-B2 \& B1-C2 \end{Emphasize}  
 This project will provide the radiation-hydrodynamic models of the
wind which are needed by project B2 for the
chemical calculations and by project C2 for the dust
entrainment in the photoevaporative wind. Project BI depends on input
from project B2 for the 
reduced network and on project A2 for observational input. \\
\begin{Emphasize}  B1-C1  \end{Emphasize}  Project B1 connects to project C1, which is concerned with
dust traps, by providing gas density structures to investigate
possible pressure bumps at the edge of the cavity. \\
\begin{Emphasize}  B1-D1 \& B1-D2 \end{Emphasize} 
Project B1 will connect with projects D1 (planet-disk
interactions) and D2 (non-axissymmetric features) at the end of
the first or in the second funding period of the Research Unit. At
this stage the results from projects D1 and D2 will be available to
combine photoevaporation to planet-disk interaction and
non-axissymmetric disk calculations, to provide a unified picture
of TDs. \\
\begin{Emphasize} B2-C1 \& B2-C2  \end{Emphasize}
Astrochemistry is extremely sensitive to the dust abundances and size
distribution. The team from 
project C1 will provide important inputs for the underlying dust disk 
model, while project C2 will provide the model for the dust
grains entrained in the photoevaporative wind. \\
\begin{Emphasize} B2-D1 \& B2-D2  \end{Emphasize}
An efficient astrochemical model for disks will be important for models of planet-disk
interaction and those with non-axissymmetric structures developed in
projects D1 and D2, respectively, in order to provide a possible
observable chemical signature of the theoretically modelled
structures. We expect this connection to become active toward the end
of the first funding period or in the second funding period of the
Research Unit. \\
\begin{Emphasize}  C1-C2  \end{Emphasize} The effects of dust traps studied in
project C1 are relevant to the grains entrained in a photovaporative
wind (C2), since these depend on the underlying dust
distribution. Project C1 \& C2 can thus tackle some common questions: ``What is the effect of dust traps in the underlying disk
on the grain entrainment? Can one expect signatures of this process to
be observed either in the continuum emission in the wind or in the
molecular lines observations?''. The reverse question is also
interesting:''What is the effect of photoevaporation on the evolution
of the underlying dust grains?''.  If the wind removes the gas, but the dust has
  grown to large enough sizes that they are not dragged along (because they
  have settled below the base of the wind) then the dust-to-gas ratio in the
  disk will be increased, possibly triggering the streaming instability, and
  thus possible planet formation, albeit in a somewhat later stage of disk
  evolution \citep[e.g.][]{2005ApJ...623L.149T}.\\
\begin{Emphasize}  C1-D1 \& C1-D2  \end{Emphasize}
  The C1 project will also benefit from 
frequent exchange with projects D1 (planet-disk interactions) and D2
(non-axissymmetric features in disks)
particularly the planet-disk interaction models and the Lagrangian
particle modules for the PLUTO code. Vice-versa, D1 in particular will
benefit from the dust and collision models created in this
project. \\
\begin{Emphasize}  C2-D1 \& C2-D2 \end{Emphasize} At the end of the first funding period, if time allows, or
in the second funding period, the dust entrainment models developed in
project C2 will be expanded to investigate the effects of
non-axisymmetric underlying disks, for which the models developed in
projects D1 (planet-disk interactions) and D2 (non-axissymmetric
features in disks) will provide the initial conditions.  \\
\begin{Emphasize}  D1-D2 \end{Emphasize} A strong technical 
  collaboration within this Forschergruppe will be carried
  out between the postdocs of projects D1 and D2, mainly because
  they employ (in spite of their different goals) to a substantial
  extent similar modelling techniques and codes. This
  collaboration with be more than the sum of the two, because it will
  allow both postdocs to more easily overcome the unavoidable technical
  difficulties of 3-D hydrodynamic modelling of protoplanetary disks.
% Projects D1 and D2 have several
%   methods in common, in particular both employing 2-D and 3-D
%   (radiation-)hydrodynamics of protoplanetary disks.  On the technical side
%   both postdocs are envisioned to collaborate closely. 
% 
%  The first two
%   projects of D2 are also topically somewhat overlapping with project
%   D1: focusing on planet-disk interaction as an explanation for Type 2 TDs.
%   The differences are: D2 focus on a single massive companion,
%   presumably a low mass star rather than a planet, while project D1 focuses
%   on multiple planet-mass companions. Secondly, D2 focuses on finding
%   the origin of strong deviations from circular symmetry, in part by making
%   the companion’s orbit strongly eccentric, while D1 is more focussed on 
%   the radial density variations, and putting them in the context of a
%   possible recent event of planet formation. Finally, D2 aims at explaining
%   the extremely tilted inner disks of several Type 2 TDs, which is not a
%   goal of D1.
\\

\subsection{Future perspectives}
%
While all projects presented here are self-contained and will
provide specific intermediate science products, the major strength of this program is the collaborative
work to produce a holistic picture of protoplanetary disk evolution
and dispersal, which through the study of TDs and Multi-Ringed Discs can be used
to inform us on the planet formation process. At the end of Phase 1 of
the Research Unit all theoretical models will have been significantly
improved to allow a much more realistic approach to match the
observational constraints. At the same time the systematic analysis of
the existing observations and the collection of new data will have also
provided a much clearer picture of disk structures, as possible planet
formation signatures. At the end of Phase 1 our team will be then
perfectly posed to perform the most advanced simulations of individual
objects, but also and perhaps more importantly, we will be able to
tackle the issue of demographics of TDs and Multi-Ringed Discs. Via population
synthesis models of these discs including disc dispersal, planet formation, dust
evolution, some simplified chemistry and radiative transfer, we will
be able for the first time to use disks to make predictive models of
planet formation and evolution to match existing exo-planet
statistics. 

\begin{highlight}
We thus foresee two interesting and connected lines of research in Phase 2: 
\end{highlight}

\begin{Emphasize}
i) Detailed modelling of individual objects.\\
\end{Emphasize}
This will follow mainly from the joint work of all areas and will
target both Type 1 and 2 TDs as well as Multi-Ringed Disks. The insights gained in
Phase 1 of the Research Unit will allow us to construct tailored
models of planet-disk interactions to explain specific observations of
Type 2 TDs (not necessarily obtained by our group). It will also be
interesting to perform case-specific studies of photoevaporating
warped or misaligned disks in 3D, which may
lead to some of the asymmetric structures observed. The tailored
models will allow us to decode the message in the many interesting new
features highlighted already by spatially resolved observation, which,
by the beginning of the second funding period, will have surely
delivered more surprises.  

\begin{Emphasize}
ii) Statistical distributions/demographics of Type 1 TDs. \\
\end{Emphasize}
The work carried out in Phase 1 in areas A, B and C will have resulted
in the most advanced disk dispersal models, which would have also been
calibrated for important quantities with direct observations. We will
use these models to construct population synthesis of Type 1
TD demographics (e.g. inner hole radius vs accretion
rate), to compare with available surveys in individual clusters.  
This will be a very strict, direct test of our disk models, and will
allow us to predict realistic initial conditions in a disk population at the
time of planet formation and migration, which are fundamental inputs
for planet formation models (the latter are however beyond the scope of this
proposal).  

It is inappropriate at this stage to design a more detailed program
for a potential Phase 2 of the Research Unit. As well as depending on
the outcome of our Phase 1 projects, the exact focus of a potential
extension would depend on the developments of the field as a
whole. Some general ideas go in the direction of providing the basis for more detailed chemical
and physical evolution of Solar-Nebula-type disks, needed to gain a
better understanding of the Solar System origin and composition,
including the large variety of minerals and organics found in comets
and meteorites.

environment, where complementary research programs and activities are
being carried out at all of the institutions involved.

disks, with the aim of pushing the state-of-the-art of what is
possible with current codes. Prof.~Preibisch's group can provide
support on observational aspects of high energy radiation from young
stars. Prof.~Ercolano's group comprises experts who are expert
dynamicists
and together with other Computational Astrophysics Group members (led
by Prof.~Burkert) will be
able to provide extensive support for the numerical aspects of the
projects. Prof.~Ercolano is also a research area leader (Star and
Planet Formation) at the
Excellence Cluster ``Universe'', which hosts the C2PAP computing
centre, which, as well as computing facilities, provides a team of
professional code developers to be booked on a project basis. The
coding support positions have been guaranteed by the LMU to be
continued after the end of the Universe Cluster, independent of an
eventual award for a new Cluster, which is in any case being applied for.

The Max Planck Society (MPG) is Germany's research organization for basic research and
covers a broad range of scientific disciplines.  MPE is composed of four scientific divisions and currently hosts around 280 scientific staff. The division lead by Prof.~Paola Caselli is the Center for Astrochemical Studies (CAS), where observational,
theoretical and laboratory studies are carried out. CAS is composed by 25 members,
including Postdoctoral Fellows, PhD students and research scientists. The main objectives in
the CAS group are chemical and physical processes in star and planet forming regions.  Prof.~Paola Caselli is an expert on star formation, astrochemistry, molecular
spectroscopy, magneto-hydrodynamic shocks, single dish/interferometric observations and
simulations.
CAS has available office space and computer facilities for visiting scientists and students.
CAS is building 3 laboratories (operations have started in 2016): 1. A conventional long pathlength cell for the study of
transient and stable molecules of interstellar interest; 2. A
chirpd-pulse spectrometer and supersonic jets for the study of complex organic molecules and transient molecules at very
low temperatures; 3. Ice experiment.
The MPE also hosts part of the research group of Prof.~Ewine van
Dishoeck. Her group is specialized in ALMA observations of protoplanetary
disks, in particular transition disks.  This involves both dust and gas
diagnostics, and employs astrochemical and radiative transfer models for
their interpretation.

consists of approximately 80 scientists and is headed by Prof.~Henning.
Apart from studying star formation, this department puts also a strong focus
on the study of planet formation and protoplanetary disks, both from an
observational perspective as well as through theoretical modeling.  The MPIA
is strongly involved in instrument-development, and has thus privileged
access to instruments such as VLT-SPHERE. It is actively involved in the
interpretation of SPHERE observations with radiative transfer modeling. The
MPIA hosts the IMPRS-HD programme and has a thriving scientific culture.

and growth processes of small embedded dust particles, planetesimal formation,
planet migration, circumbinary disks. Additionally the groups interest lie in the
field of computational astrophysics where new numerical methods are being developed and
implemented which includes particle-based and grid-based approaches.
The group presently hosts a Emmy-Noether research group on 'Massive star formation'

%\noindent{\bf \em Interactions between projects and institutions.}\\
\subsection{Interactions between projects and institutions}
\label{sec-interactions-between-projects}
\noindent The projects planned are not only collaborative amongst institutions,
but also have strong dependencies on each other, which is the
motivation for setting up a Research Unit. Several members of the
network already work regularly together, so we foresee that this compact
network will benefit from close-knit collaboration amongst its members.
As well as links between the projects we have also links between
various institutions within one project, which are led by people from
different institutions. Furthermore, we foresee
strong links between our groups and those of our external
collaborators, in particular Prof.~T. Henning (MPIA) and Prof.~E. van
Dishoeck (MPE/Leiden). Each group will reserve a workplace especially 
for such exchanges, both within Munich/Garching as well as across the nodes. 

Furthermore, we plan to keep communications between and within teams in
projects as lively as possible. This requires regular travel.
We plan the following meetings and working visits:
\begin{compactitemize}
\item A kickoff and wrap up events at the start and end of Phase 1 of the
  Research Unit. These events will also be open to non-members, who may
  provide external support and collaborate on some of the projects.
\item Twice a year a two-day face to face meeting with all members at
  rotating locations amongst the institutes in the Research Unit (The
  first and last of these meetings will be replaced by the kick-off
  and wrap-up meeting described above). 
\item Connected to these meetings we will occasionally (in particular in the
  first year) organize special-purpose tutorials and lectures for the PhD
  students and Postdocs of this RU. This is done by adding one or two extra
  days to the above mentioned meetings. The tutorials are aimed at learning
  each-other's methods (e.g.\ the use of a particular hydrodynamics or
  radiative transfer code, or standard software such as CASA or Python
  libraries) and will be given by volunteers among the PhD students and
  postdocs themselves. The lectures will be given by volunteers among the
  PIs of this RU, and are aimed to bring the PhD students and Postdocs of
  this RU up to the same knowledge level on the topics of this RU.  Both
  tutorials and lectures will be RU-member-only, so as to have small groups
  and thus excellent interactivity.
\item Once a month a video conference amongst members of a given area, where
  the young researchers will present status reports of the various
  projects. A concise summary of the meeting will then be compiled on a
  rotation basis by the students/postdocs in the area and then distributed
  to all members.
\item Collaboration meetings between individual projects, which can be 
  organized in an ad-hoc fashion.
\item We request a substantial budget for longer working visits so that
  students/postdocs will not work in just one institute, but effectively
  work in multiple.

%\noindent{\bf \em Promotion of Early career researchers}\\
\subsection{Promotion of Early career researchers}

\noindent We have requested a mix of PhD and Postdoc positions, the
latter because of the complex computational aspects of some of the
projects in this building phase of the Research Unit. We are very
committed to the training and the promotion of young researchers, and
indeed most of the Postdocs are planned to be junior positions (within
three years of PhD). The nature of the projects themselves is
favourable to the promotion of early career researchers by providing
them with definite and clear science products as well as training them
in highly sought-after skills, which will propel them in today's
challenging academic world. The planned 
tutorial/lecture sessions discussed in Section 
\ref{sec-interactions-between-projects}, with the emphasis on small
interactive groups and ``for-student-by-student'' tutorials on often-used
techniques, will contribute to this. The Research Unit with the thriving
interactions and the team work towards a common goal also provide a
perfect environment to develop a broad view of interrelated, but
fundamentally different research areas, which will especially benefit
PhD students and academically young postdocs. The postdocs will be
encouraged and supported to develop independence, which will set them
up on a career path to individual fellowships. 

%\mbox{}\vspace{1em}\\
%\noindent{\bf \em Gender Equality Measures}\\
\subsection{Gender Equality Measures}

Our PI team is already relatively balanced in terms of gender. We will
continue to work towards creating a still
more balanced team of female and male PhDs and Postdocs in this
Research Unit. We will also particularly stimulate women to apply for the theoretical research positions of our Forschergruppe, to amend the relative paucity of women in theoretical areas of (astro)physics.

%\mbox{}\vspace{1em}\\
%\noindent{\bf \em Family Support Measures}\\
\subsection{Family Support Measures}

Family support is of prime importance in our Research Unit, and we are
aware of the complicated issues of work/family balance. In particular
care will be taken in the scheduling of the biannual Research Unit
meetings, which will necessarily involve traveling, in order to
minimise disruption to family life. When possible we will use
video-conferencing (e.g.\ for the regular monthly meetings), and will
provide financial support to members who wish to travel with a
caretaker for their small children
for the face-to-face meetings, which we foresee to be at
least twice a year (on top of the Phase 1 kick-off and wrap-up
meetings), and for the longer collaboration visits. Details are given
in Project Z.
