\noindent{\bf Abstract:}\\

The search for the smoking gun of disc dispersal via photoevaporative
winds, which destroy discs via the formation of Type 1 TDs,  has until
now failed to identify suitable tracers. Quantitative spectroscopy of
YSOs to search for blue-shifted emission lines produced in the wind
relies on an accurate characterisation of the thermochemical
properties of the winds. A central ingredients for the chemical
calculations is the dust content of the wind as micron sized grains
provide the dominant opacity channel in the far-ultraviolet,
furthermore small particles are important players in the temperature
balance of the gas via the photoelectric process.  

We will use realistic radiation-hydrodynamic models of
photoevaporative winds coupled to dust evolution models for the
underlying grain distribution in the disc, to calculate the dust
entrainment in winds to feed to chemical models. The observability of
the continuum emission due to the dust grains in winds from edge-on
discs, a potential new diagnostic, will be estimated both for Herbig
Ae stars and for their fainter T-Tauri counterparts.  

\section{\Tcol State of the art and preliminary work}
\renewcommand{\leftmark}{\sc State of the Art and preliminary work}

The dispersal of protoplanetary discs plays a crucial role in the
planet formation process, and it is witnessed by the formation of Type
1 TDs. While photoevaporation from the central star has been proposed
as the dominant disc-dispersal mechanism around low-mass stars
(e.g. Clarke et 2001), to date only tentative evidence exists of a
wind detection, via blue-shifted forbidden line emission of mostly
NeII and OI (e.g. Hartigan, Edwards \& Ghandour 1995; Alexander 2008;
Pascucci \& Sterzik 2009; Schisano, Ercolano \& Guedel 2010; Ercolano
\& Owen 2010). These lines can only probe the wind on very local
scales and they cannot be inverted to obtain mass loss rates, which
are crucial to pin down the driving dispersal wind mechanism
(i.e. EUV, FUV or X-ray - or a combination). Different driving
mechanism induce more or less vigorous mass loss at different disc
radii, which  can have dramatic effect on planet formation, both at
the times of planetesimal assembly and for the later dynamical
evolution of planet(esimal)s (e.g. Ercolano \& Rosotti 2015).  

Owen, Ercolano \& Clarke (2011b) demonstrated that in the case of
Herbig Ae/Be stars an EUV-driven wind, the wind selectively entrains
grains of different sizes at different radii resulting in a dust
population that varies spatially and increases with height above the
disc at radii larger than about 10~AU. At near infrared wavelengths
this variable grain population produces a 'wingnut' morphology which
may have already been observed in the case of PDS 144N (Perrin et
al. 2006). The work of Owen et al. (2011b) could not however reproduce
the colour gradient of the observations, which show redder emission at
larger heights above the disc. Possibly, the problem was due to the
fact that the synthetic images were dominated by emission from the
smallest grains entrained in the flow. Grain growth, neglected in the
Owen et al. (2011b) calculations in the disc is a natural solution to
the colour problem, which needs to be taken into account in future
simulations.  

While it is currently not clear if the PDS 144N observation can be
explained by dust entrainment in a photoevaporative wind, the work of
Owen, Ercolano \& Clarke (2011b) has clearly demonstrated that a
significant amount of small grains (which dominate the opacity in the
FUV) do populate disc winds, hence playing an important part in the
chemistry there and at the base of the flow. The Owen,
Ercolano \& Clarke (2011b) calculation are limited to the EUV-case
only and do not include dust-evolution in the underlying disc. In this project
we aim to determine the dust content of photoevaporative winds for the
EUV and X-ray case for a range of stellar, disc and wind parameters,
using realistic descriptions for grain growth in the underlying
disc. 

The main science product of this project, i.e. the grain
distributions, is needed by project B1, however as a by-product we
will also use the results to predict the observational appearance of the wind in
infrared continuum for the various cases. In the case of Herbig Ae
stars these winds may be observable for edge-on discs as discussed in
Owen et al. (2011b) and may provide an interesting wind diagnostic.

\section{\Tcol Objectives and work programme}
\renewcommand{\leftmark}{\sc Objectives and work programme}


\subsection{\Tcol Anticipated total duration of the project}

36 months

\subsection{\Tcol Objectives}

\indent 1. Build a dust model for photoevaporative winds to be used in chemical calculations. \\
\indent 2. Estimate the observability and observation characteristics of the dust phase in photoevaporative winds. 

\subsection{\Tcol Work programme including proposed research methods}
% for each applicant

\noindent{\bf Strategy of the proposed project:}\\
For this project we will need the following tools: \\
\indent 1. Photoevaporative wind solutions for EUV and X-ray photoevaporated winds for T-Tauri and Herbig stars (the latter only for the EUV case)\\
\indent 2. Parameterised dust growth models (e.g. Birnstiel, Klahr \&
  Ercolano, 2012) and, successively, dust evolution results from project C1. \\
\indent 3. A 3D radiative transfer code to post-postprocess the wind models with the calculated grain populations. We will make use of the RadMC code developed and maintained by Prof. Dullemond.  \\

The student will start by producing wind solution for the EUV case
from the work of Font et al. (2004), which may be applicable to Herbig
stars. She/he will then proceed to calculate the dust distribution in
the wind, under simplifying assumptions for the underlying dust
distributions as in Owen et al (2011b). In brief, streamlines from the
base of the flow to the edge of the grid will be computed and along
each of them, the force balance between the drag force, gravity and
the centrifugal force will be calculated. A positive net force on a
grain along the streamline will indicate that the grain is
entrained. This first models will be benchmarked against the solutions
of Owen et al. (2011b). The student will then be in a position to
significantly improve on this work by considering grain growth and
settling in the disc, first of all using the simple prescriptions or Birnstiel,
Klahr \& Ercolano (2012). At a later stage the models will use the
results from the calculations of dust evolution carried out in project
C1. For the X-ray case the student will at first make use of the
existing wind solutions of Owen et al. (2010, 2011, 2012).This
systematic approach will allow us to distinguish amongst the various
effects and will also allow us to understand wether a more efficient,
simplified approach may then be used. 

The new wind models for the X-ray case are already being calculated by
Dr Picogna, who is employed to do the preparatory work from project B1,
and will be available to the student.  She/he will then be able to
apply the constructed and benchmarked machinery to a wide parameter
space, performing radiative transfer calculations of the obtained
structures to compare with available observations or to make
observability predictions which may guide future observing
proposals. We will join forces with expert collaborators on scattered light
observations (e.g. Prof. Henning) to plan new proposals, however we note
that failure to obtain new observations does not preclude the main
aims of this projects to be achieved. The most important science
product from this project is in fact, the grain models developed for the 
X-ray driven wind, which are needed by project B1 for the chemical
calculations. This is crucial as the dust grains are not equally
distributed in the wind (see e.g. Owen, Ercolano \& Clarke, 2012) and affect the chemistry of the wind
differently in different part. We stress that a simple estimate from a
non-detection is not sufficient to rule out the relevance of grains on
the chemical calculations. 
\noindent 

If time allows, the student will collaborate with Dr Picogna (B1) to produce full hydrodynamical simulations of disc winds, where the component in the disc and wind is treated as particles (e.g. Picogna \& Kley 2016). These calculations, which are computationally expensive will be seful as a comparison to the simpler methods previously employed by the student in the project. 

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent {\bf Links to the other projects / collaborations:}
The project will use the wind models calculated in project B1 and then
feed back the dust model to the same project (B1) and to the reduced
chemical network tests of project B2. Dust evolution calculations from C1 will also be used. Observational constraints will
be obtained in collaboration with experts working on project A1 and
stellar properties to guide the models 
from project A2. 

\subsection{\Tcol Data handling}

The model data-grids will be made available on the Research Unit dedicated
server for use within the team. 

Furthermore we will provide a set of
diagnostic models to guide observers in the wider community on the
public partition of the server. 

\color{green}{Til can we also provide perhaps other useful data from
  the dust models?}
